# Documentation Meta

Internal planning and organization docs for Tero's public documentation.

## What's Here

**organization.md** - How we structure the docs (tabs, sections, why)

**manual.md** - Complete outline for the Manual section

## Writing Style

Follow the writing guidelines in `../knowledge-base/meta/writing.md`. Same tone applies to public docs: conversational, direct, no corporate fluff. Build mental models progressively.

For personal AI collaboration preferences, see `../binarylogic/ai`.
