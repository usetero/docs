Workspaces let different teams manage the same data for different purposes. Security, observability, compliance: each gets their own policies for the same catalog.

Most organizations don't need workspaces. One account, one set of policies, multiple teams. Workspaces become useful when teams have fundamentally different goals for the same telemetry.

## When to use workspaces

Your security team wants to keep all authentication logs with full context. Your observability team wants to sample them and drop the tokens. Your compliance team wants to archive everything for 90 days.

Without workspaces, these goals conflict. Someone has to compromise. With workspaces, each team manages their own policies. Same catalog, different decisions.

## How it works

The [Master Catalog](/master-catalog/overview) is shared across workspaces. Every workspace sees the same services, log events, metrics, and traces. The catalog is built at the account level.

Policies are per-workspace. Each workspace evaluates the catalog and creates its own policies. The security workspace keeps auth logs. The observability workspace samples them. No conflict.

## Enforcement

Workspaces map to destinations. How policies apply depends on your routing:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Separate destinations">
    Security logs go to your SIEM, observability logs go to Datadog. Each workspace's policies apply to its destination.

      style Datadog fill:#632ca6,stroke:#262626,color:#fff
    ```

    Clean separation. Each team controls what reaches their destination.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Different indices">
    Both teams use Datadog, but security uses a dedicated index. Tero tags security-relevant logs, and Datadog's index filters route them.

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
      Services --> Tero
      Tero -->|tag + policies| Datadog
      Datadog -->|"tero.security:true"| SecurityIndex[Security Index]
      Datadog -->|everything else| MainIndex[Main Index]

      style Services fill:#262626,stroke:#262626,color:#fafafa
      style Tero fill:#10b981,stroke:#262626,color:#fff
      style Datadog fill:#632ca6,stroke:#262626,color:#fff
      style SecurityIndex fill:#0e2b22,stroke:#0e2b22,color:#fafafa
      style MainIndex fill:#0e2b22,stroke:#0e2b22,color:#fafafa
    ```

    The security workspace configures which logs get tagged as security-relevant. You set up a Datadog index with filter `tero.security:true` and order it before your main index. Security logs route there, everything else falls through.

    This can dramatically reduce security index costs since you're only sending what security actually needs, not all your observability data.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Same index">
    Both teams query the same data. Tero unions the policies before enforcement.

    ```mermaid
    flowchart LR
      Services --> Tero
      Tero --> Security[Security Workspace]
      Tero --> Observability[Observability Workspace]
      Security --> Union
      Observability --> Union
      Union -->|combined policies| Datadog

      style Services fill:#262626,stroke:#262626,color:#fafafa
      style Tero fill:#10b981,stroke:#262626,color:#fff
      style Security fill:#0e2b22,stroke:#0e2b22,color:#fafafa
      style Observability fill:#0e2b22,stroke:#0e2b22,color:#fafafa
      style Union fill:#10b981,stroke:#262626,color:#fff
      style Datadog fill:#632ca6,stroke:#262626,color:#fff
    ```

    The more permissive policy wins. Security wants to keep auth logs, observability wants to drop them? They're kept.

## Creating workspaces

Create a workspace in **Settings → Workspaces**. Assign teams to it. Those teams manage policies for that workspace.

Each workspace has its own:
- Policy decisions and approvals
- Enforcement configuration
- Data quality metrics and SLOs

The catalog, services, and integrations remain shared at the account level.
