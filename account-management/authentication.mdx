Tero supports multiple sign-in methods and integrates with your identity provider for SSO and automatic user provisioning.

## Sign-in methods

Configure which methods are available in **Settings → Authentication**. Enable any combination, or require SSO only.

### Email and password

Users create an account with their email. You can disable this method entirely if you require SSO.

#### MFA

For email/password accounts, you can require multi-factor authentication. Users signing in via SSO or social login use their provider's MFA instead.

### Social login

Users sign in with an existing account. Enable the providers you want to allow:

  <Card title="Google" icon="google" />
  <Card title="GitHub" icon="github" />
  <Card title="Microsoft" icon="microsoft" />
</CardGroup>

### Single sign-on

Connect your identity provider. Users authenticate through your IdP with your existing security policies.

Tero supports SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect with all major providers:

  <Card title="Azure AD" icon="microsoft" />
  <Card title="Google Workspace" icon="google" />
  <Card title="OneLogin" icon="key" />
  <Card title="JumpCloud" icon="cloud" />
  <Card title="PingFederate" icon="circle-nodes" />
  <Card title="Auth0" icon="lock" />
  <Card title="ADFS" icon="server" />
  <Card title="Duo" icon="shield-halved" />
</CardGroup>

Any SAML 2.0 or OIDC-compatible provider works.

#### Setup

Go to **Settings → Authentication → Configure SSO** to open the admin portal.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your domain">
    Add a DNS TXT record to prove you own your domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your IdP">
    Follow the guided setup for your identity provider. The portal provides IdP-specific instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the connection">
    Verify SSO works before enabling for your organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once configured, you can require SSO for all users, disabling email/password and social login. Your IT team can access the admin portal directly to manage configuration, view connection status, and troubleshoot issues.

## Directory sync

Sync users and groups from your identity provider automatically. Enable directory sync in the admin portal after configuring SSO.

- **User provisioning** — Users are created when they're added to your IdP and removed when they leave. No manual account management.
- **Group sync** — Select which IdP groups to sync. Map them to Tero teams so users get access to the right services automatically.
- **Real-time updates** — Changes propagate automatically. Your IdP is the source of truth.

The admin portal shows sync status, connected users, and group mappings. Your IT team can manage this independently.

## Roles

- **Admin** — Full access. Manage settings, integrations, users, and teams. Approve any policy.
- **Member** — Access to assigned services. Review and approve policies for those services.

Roles can be assigned manually or mapped from IdP groups during directory sync.
