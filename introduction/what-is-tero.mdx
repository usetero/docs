Tero is a control plane for observability data.

Connect your stack. Tero builds a [Master Catalog](/master-catalog): every service, every log event, every metric, understood semantically. Not just format, but meaning.

From that understanding, Tero generates [policies](/policies): atomic rules that capture data quality improvements. Each one does one thing. You can read it and know exactly what it does. Once you fix a data quality mistake, the policy keeps it fixed. No regression, no repeating the same cleanup.

You review them, approve them, and Tero [enforces](/policies/enforcement) them wherever makes sense.

Control planes manage desired state. You declare the target, they make reality match. Tero does that for your observability data.

Why does this matter? Because observability isn't expensive. It's dirty. At least half of what you're sending to your provider is waste: debug logs that never got turned off, health checks firing every second, redundant fields in every log. It accumulates because nobody can see it. Pipelines move data but don't understand it. Vendors bill by volume so they don't care.

Tero cleans it up and keeps it clean. Better observability, lower costs. Not a tradeoff.
