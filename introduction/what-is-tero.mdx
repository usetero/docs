Tero is an intelligence layer for observability.

It connects to your existing tools and understands your data in a way no one else can. Not the format. The meaning. What each log event, metric, and trace represents, whether it matters, how it connects to your services and failure scenarios.

That understanding powers everything Tero does. Answer questions no one else can, like [what percentage of your data is waste](/questions/waste). Fix problems in your code by opening PRs that clean up instrumentation at the source. Configure your provider. Enforce policies at the edge. Catch mistakes as they happen.

Ultimately, Tero helps you get more with less. When you fix the data, everything else simplifies. Your pipeline does less. Your costs drop. Your dashboards get cleaner. The monthly fire drills stop. This isn't another tool to manage. It's the tool that gets you to fewer tools.
