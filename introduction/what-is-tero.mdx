Tero is an intelligence layer for observability. It connects to your existing tools (Datadog, Splunk, whatever you're running) and understands your telemetry data in a way no one else can.

Not just format and structure. Meaning. What each piece of data means, when it matters, how signals connect across your systems.

That understanding lets Tero [answer questions](/questions/waste) no one else can. You ask, Tero answers. The more you use it, the smarter it gets. Context compounds as you connect integrations and interact with your data.

Tero is complementary. It doesn't replace your observability stack. It makes it better. We don't store your data. We don't charge by volume. Start read-only, ask questions, then take action.
