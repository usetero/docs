Tero is an intelligence layer for observability. It sits alongside your existing tools—Datadog, Splunk, Prometheus, whatever you're running—and builds a semantic understanding of your telemetry data.

Not just the format. What it *means*. What's valuable, what's waste, how different signals connect.

That understanding lets us answer questions no one else can. Questions like: **what percentage of your observability data is waste?**

## Why this matters

If you're responsible for observability at your company, you know the pattern. Costs grow faster than value. Engineers need robust telemetry to debug production issues. Finance needs budget discipline. You're stuck in the middle, playing cost cop—checking dashboards, running cleanup exercises, begging your vendor for forgiveness when someone's log explodes the bill.

The problem isn't pricing. It's that nobody actually understands the data.

Your vendor sees bytes. Your pipeline moves data without comprehending it. Your team has intuitions but no comprehensive view. So you pay for everything, hope it's all valuable, and carry the anxiety that you're missing something.

Tero changes this. We build a context graph of your telemetry—every log event, every service, every pattern, cataloged and understood. Then we use that understanding to answer the questions that matter.

## The hardest question first

The first question we answer is the one no vendor will touch: **what percentage of your data is waste?**

Not a guess. Not sampling recommendations. An actual answer, backed by semantic analysis of every piece of data you produce.

We'll show you the percentage. We'll break it down by service, by team, by log type. We'll explain exactly what's wasteful and why. And we'll help you fix it—through your existing tools, with no infrastructure changes required.

Typical results: 40-70% volume reduction. Hundreds of thousands in annual savings. And finally, an answer to the question your vendor won't give you.

## What comes next

Waste identification is the first proof of understanding, not the destination. The same context graph that evaluates data quality can answer any question about your systems:
- Why is this service slow?
- What changed in the last deploy?
- What should I alert on?

Over time, Tero becomes where you go to understand your infrastructure. Not because we replaced your tools, but because we understand your data better than anyone.

## How it works with what you have

Tero is complementary. We integrate with your existing observability tools via API. We don't own storage. We don't charge by volume. We're the intelligence layer that makes whatever you're running more valuable.

For Datadog customers, we read through Datadog's API, build the context graph, and configure improvements directly in Datadog. No deploys, no infrastructure changes, no risk. You can start with read-only access—we'll show you your waste percentage before you let us change anything.
