Tero is an intelligence layer for observability. It connects to your existing tools (Datadog, Splunk, whatever you're running) and builds a semantic understanding of your telemetry data.

Not just format and structure. Meaning. What each log event represents, when it matters, how signals connect across your systems.

That understanding lets Tero answer questions no one else can. You ask questions, Tero answers them. Context compounds over time as you connect more integrations and interact with your data.

Tero is complementary. It doesn't replace your observability stack. It makes it better. We don't store your data. We don't charge by volume. Start read-only, see what we find, then decide what to do about it.
