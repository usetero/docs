Most observability problems aren't platform problems. They're data problems: too much noise, not enough signal, no way to know what's worth keeping.

Tero is a control plane for observability data. It connects to your existing stack (Datadog, Splunk, your collectors) and analyzes every log, metric, and trace. Not just the format. The meaning: what each event represents, whether it matters, what's waste.

That understanding surfaces as [rules](/data-quality/overview): this field duplicates that one, this log is a health check firing 86,400 times a day, this debug statement shipped to production. You review, approve, and Tero enforces. Permanently.

Like a control plane for your infrastructure, but for your data. Declare what clean looks like, enforce it everywhere, catch drift when it happens.
