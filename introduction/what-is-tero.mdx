Tero is an intelligent control plane for observability data.

It connects to your existing tools: Datadog, Splunk, your collectors, your pipelines. It builds [context](/context) from your data — every log event, every metric, every trace span. Not just the format. The meaning. What each log event represents, whether it matters, what's waste and what's valuable.

That understanding becomes rules.

Tero surfaces them by category: redundant attributes, health check logs, stray debugging, verbose payloads, repetitive events, PII leakage. Each rule is a specific statement: this field duplicates that one, this log is infrastructure noise, this event fires a thousand times but represents one problem, this field contains a credit card number.

You review. You approve. Tero enforces — *permanently*.

Rules can execute at the [edge](/edge), configure your provider, open PRs in your code, or create tickets for your engineers. You choose how to act. Tero monitors for regression. Problems you fix stay fixed.

This is the system you've been building manually: exclusion filters before renewals, pipeline rules you forgot about, Slack messages asking engineers to fix their logging. All of it formalized. All of it enforced. All of it permanent.

Most teams find 40-70% of their observability data is waste. Tero eliminates it. Every rule you approve builds leverage.
