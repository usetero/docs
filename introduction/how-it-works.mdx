Tero connects to your existing observability tools and works in four steps.

## 1. Connect

Tero connects to your observability tools in read-only mode, securely reading your telemetry data without disrupting your existing setup.

</Frame>

- **Non-intrusive**: Connect via API using service accounts. No agents, no code changes.
- **No infrastructure changes**: Your setup stays exactly as it is.
- **Start read-only**: See what Tero finds before you change anything.

## 2. Understand

The control plane analyzes your telemetry and builds the context graph. A semantic understanding of what your data means.

  <img src="/images/how-it-works-2.svg" alt="Understand your data" />
</Frame>

- **Log events cataloged**: Billions of logs compressed into thousands of semantic events.
- **Patterns discovered**: Relationships between services, errors, and signals mapped.
- **Meaning attached**: Not just format. What each piece of data represents and when it matters.

## 3. Ask

You ask questions. Tero answers using the context graph.

</Frame>

- **Start with waste**: "How much of my data is waste?" is the first question Tero answers.
- **Transparent analysis**: See exactly why each piece of data is classified the way it is.
- **Full control**: Approve, adjust, or reject recommendations based on your context.

## 4. Enforce

Deploy policies to eliminate waste. Choose where and how they run.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-agentless.svg" alt="Agentless enforcement via Datadog API" />
    </Frame>

    - **No deployment required**: Tero configures exclusion rules directly in Datadog.
    - **Immediate effect**: Waste stops flowing as soon as you approve.
    - **Fully reversible**: Remove rules anytime with zero risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Datadog Agent">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-datadog-agent.svg" alt="Datadog Agent distribution" />
    </Frame>

    - **Drop-in replacement**: Our build of the Datadog Agent with Tero's policy engine.
    - **Same config, new capabilities**: Your existing setup plus policy enforcement.
    - **Filter at source**: Policies execute before data leaves your infrastructure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OTel Collector">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-otel-collector.svg" alt="OTel Collector distribution" />
    </Frame>

    - **Drop-in replacement**: Our build of OTel Collector with Tero's policy engine.
    - **Same config, new capabilities**: Your existing setup plus policy enforcement.
    - **Filter at source**: Policies execute before data leaves your infrastructure.
