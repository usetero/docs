Tero is an intelligent control plane. It sits above your existing tools and makes them better. It doesn't replace anything.

## Observability platforms

**Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, Grafana**

These are where your data lives. They store it, query it, visualize it. Tero connects to them via API and builds context on top.

Your platform knows the format of your data. Tero knows the meaning: which logs matter during incidents, which metrics are never queried, what's waste and what's valuable. That understanding becomes rules you can enforce.

You can swap platforms, add new ones, run multiple. Tero works across all of them. The rules are portable.

## Pipelines

**Cribl, Vector, Fluent Bit, OTel Collector**

Pipelines move data. They route, transform, filter. They're infrastructure.

The challenge with pipelines is knowing what rules to write. You're guessing at what's safe to drop, maintaining regex lists that break when systems change, becoming a bottleneck for every filtering decision.

Tero surfaces the rules. You review and approve them. They execute wherever you want: in the pipeline, at the [edge](/edge), in your provider, or in your code. The intelligence lives in Tero. The execution lives wherever makes sense.

If you don't have a pipeline, you might not need one. If you do have a pipeline, Tero makes it smarter.

## Cost tools

**CloudZero, Vantage**

Cost visibility tools show you what you're spending. Dashboards, reports, breakdowns by team or service. Useful for understanding the bill.

Tero goes further. We show you what's causing the cost and how to fix it. Which data is waste, why it's waste, and rules to eliminate it. The goal isn't a better dashboard. It's a smaller bill.

## AI observability tools

There's a lot of AI-washing in observability right now. "AI-powered root cause analysis." "AI-driven insights." Most of it is surface-level.

Here's a simple test: ask them what percentage of your data is waste. They can't answer it. That question requires complete visibility and genuine semantic understanding of every piece of data.

We can answer it. And we don't just tell you the number — we show you the rules, organized by category, so you can see exactly what's waste and why. That's the proof. Everything else Tero does builds on that foundation.
