Tero is a control plane. It sits above your existing tools and makes them better. It doesn't replace anything.

## Observability platforms

**Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, Grafana**

These are where your data lives. They store it, query it, visualize it. Tero connects via API and builds understanding on top.

Your platform knows the format of your data. Tero knows the meaning: which logs matter during incidents, which metrics are never queried, what's waste and what's valuable. That understanding becomes rules you can enforce.

Swap platforms, add new ones, run multiple. Tero works across all of them. The rules are portable.

## Pipelines

**Cribl, Vector, Fluent Bit, OTel Collector**

Pipelines move data. They route, transform, filter. They're infrastructure.

The challenge is knowing what rules to write. You're guessing at what's safe to drop, maintaining regex lists that break when systems change, becoming a bottleneck for every filtering decision.

Tero surfaces the rules. You review and approve. They execute wherever you want: in the pipeline, at the [edge](/edge/overview), in your provider, or in your code. The understanding lives in Tero. The execution lives wherever makes sense.

If you don't have a pipeline, you might not need one. If you do, Tero makes it smarter.

## Cost tools

**CloudZero, Vantage**

Cost tools show you what you're spending. Dashboards, reports, breakdowns by team or service.

Tero shows you what's wrong with your data and how to fix it. Costs drop as a consequence of cleaning up the waste. The goal isn't a better dashboard. It's better data.

## AI observability tools

Ask any of them: what percentage of my data is waste? They can't answer it. That question requires understanding every piece of data, not just pattern matching on queries.

Tero can answer it. And we don't just give you a number. We show you the rules, organized by category, with examples from your actual data. That's the proof of understanding. Everything else Tero does builds on that foundation.
