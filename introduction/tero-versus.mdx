Tero is an intelligence layer. It sits above your existing tools and makes them better. It doesn't replace anything.

## Observability platforms

**Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, Grafana**

These are where your data lives. They store it, query it, visualize it. Tero connects to them via API and builds understanding on top.

Your platform knows the format of your data. Tero knows the meaning: which logs matter during incidents, which metrics are never queried, what's waste and what's valuable. That understanding helps you get more out of what you're already paying for.

You can swap platforms, add new ones, run multiple. Tero works across all of them. The intelligence is portable.

## Pipelines

**Cribl, Vector, Fluent Bit, OTel Collector**

Pipelines move data. They route, transform, filter. They're infrastructure.

The challenge with pipelines is knowing what rules to write. You're guessing at what's safe to drop, maintaining regex lists that break when systems change, becoming a bottleneck for every filtering decision.

Tero tells you what rules to write. We analyze your data, identify what's valuable and what's waste, and generate policies. You choose where to execute them:

- **Distributions**: drop-in replacements for tools you already run (Datadog Agent, Vector, OTel Collector, Fluent Bit) with Tero's policy engine built in. Same config, new capabilities.
- **[Tero Edge](/edge/overview)**: a lightweight proxy that intercepts traffic. No tool changes required.
- **Agentless**: configure rules directly in your provider via API. No infrastructure at all.

If you don't have a pipeline, you might not need one. Tero can work agentlessly or with Edge. If you do have a pipeline, Tero makes it smarter.

## Cost tools

**CloudZero, Vantage**

Cost visibility tools show you what you're spending. Dashboards, reports, breakdowns by team or service. Useful for understanding the bill.

Tero goes further. We don't just show you the cost, we show you what's causing it and how to fix it. Which data is waste, why it's waste, and how to eliminate it. The goal isn't a better dashboard. It's a smaller bill.

## AI observability tools

There's a lot of AI-washing in observability right now. "AI-powered root cause analysis." "AI-driven insights." Most of it is surface-level.

Here's a simple test: ask them what percentage of your data is waste. They can't answer it. That question requires complete visibility and genuine semantic understanding of every piece of data.

We can answer it. That's our proof point. Everything else Tero does builds on that same foundation of understanding.
