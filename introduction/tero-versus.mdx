Tero isn't competing with your observability stack. It's a new layer that makes everything you already have better.

## vs Observability Platforms

**Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, Grafana**

They store your data and let you query it. We understand it.

Your platform sees bytes: log lines, metric values, trace spans. Tero sees meaning. We know which logs matter during incidents, which metrics are never queried, which data is waste.

We're not a replacement. We connect to your platform via API, build understanding on top of it, and help you get more value from what you're already paying for.

## vs Pipelines

**Cribl, Vector, Fluent**

They move data. We understand it.

Pipelines are powerful infrastructure. They route, transform, filter. But they do what you tell them. You write the rules. When your systems change, your rules break.

Tero tells you what rules to write. We analyze your data, identify what's valuable and what's waste, and generate policies. You can run those policies on your existing pipeline, on our edge, or configure them directly in your vendor.

## vs Cost Tools

**CloudZero, Vantage**

They show you what you're spending. We fix it.

Cost visibility tools give you dashboards and reports. You see the bill, maybe broken down by team or service. But knowing you're spending too much doesn't tell you what to do about it.

Tero gives you action. Here's the waste, here's why it's waste, here's how to eliminate it. The bill goes down, not just the dashboard.

## vs AI Observability

**The "AI SRE" products**

We prove we understand your data. They claim to.

There's a lot of AI-washing in observability right now. "AI-powered root cause analysis." "AI-driven insights." Ask them a simple question: what percentage of my data is waste? They can't answer it.

We can. That question requires complete visibility and genuine semantic understanding. Answering it is our proof. Everything else we do builds on that same foundation.
