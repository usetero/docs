Tero connects to your existing observability tools and works in four steps.

## 1. Connect

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-1.svg" alt="Connect to your tools" />
</Frame>

Tero connects to your observability tools via API using service accounts. Read-only by default. No agents to deploy, no code changes, no infrastructure changes. Your setup stays exactly as it is.

## 2. Build context

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-2.svg" alt="Understand your data" />
</Frame>

Tero analyzes your telemetry and builds [context](/context/overview): a semantic understanding of what your data means. Billions of logs compress into thousands of meaningful events. Relationships between services, errors, and signals get mapped. Each piece of data gets meaning attached, not just format, but what it represents and when it matters.

## 3. Ask questions

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-3.svg" alt="Ask questions" />
</Frame>

You ask [questions](/questions/waste), Tero answers using the context it's built. [How much data is waste?](/questions/waste) [Are there data spikes?](/questions/data-spikes) [Is PII leaking?](/questions/pii) The context powers the answers.

## 4. Take action

Once Tero identifies the problem and explains why, you decide what to do. Multiple options, not mutually exclusive.

  <Accordion title="In your provider" defaultOpen>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-agentless.svg" alt="Configure provider exclusion rules" />
    </Frame>

    No deployment required. Tero configures exclusion rules directly in your provider. Waste stops being indexed as soon as you apply the rule. Fully reversible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In your code">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-code.svg" alt="Fix it in your code" />
    </Frame>

    Tero can open a PR with the fix for you to review and merge. Or use Tero as an MCP so developers understand what to change. Or just use the analysis to make changes yourself.
