Tero connects to your existing observability tools and works in four steps.

## 1. Connect

Tero connects to your observability tools in read-only mode, securely reading your telemetry data without disrupting your existing setup.

  <img src="/images/how-it-works-1.svg" alt="Connect to your tools" />
</Frame>

- **Non-intrusive**: Connect via API using service accounts. No agents, no code changes.
- **No infrastructure changes**: Your setup stays exactly as it is.
- **Start read-only**: See what Tero finds before you change anything.

## 2. Build context

Tero analyzes your telemetry and builds [context](/context/overview)—a semantic understanding of what your data means.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-2.svg" alt="Understand your data" />
</Frame>

- **Log events cataloged**: Billions of logs compressed into thousands of semantic events.
- **Patterns discovered**: Relationships between services, errors, and signals mapped.
- **Meaning attached**: Not just format. What each piece of data represents and when it matters.

## 3. Ask questions

You ask [questions](/questions/waste). Tero answers using the context it's built.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-3.svg" alt="Ask questions" />
</Frame>

- **[How much data is waste?](/questions/waste)**: Find and eliminate low-value data.
- **[Are there data spikes?](/questions/data-spikes)**: Catch volume and cardinality explosions.
- **[Is PII leaking?](/questions/pii)**: Find and redact sensitive data.

## 4. Take action

Once Tero identifies the problem and explains why, you decide what to do. Multiple options, not mutually exclusive.

  <Accordion title="In your provider" defaultOpen>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-agentless.svg" alt="Configure provider exclusion rules" />
    </Frame>

    - **No deployment required**: Configure exclusion rules directly in your provider.
    - **Immediate effect**: Waste stops being indexed as soon as you apply the rule.
    - **Fully reversible**: Remove rules anytime with zero risk.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In your code">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-4-code.svg" alt="Fix it in your code" />
    </Frame>

    - **Open a PR**: Tero generates the fix, you review and merge.
    - **Guide developers**: Use Tero's MCP so developers understand what to change.
    - **Do it yourself**: Use Tero's analysis to make changes manually.
