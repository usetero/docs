## 1. Connect

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-generic-1.svg" alt="Connect to your observability stack" />
</Frame>

Tero connects to your observability stack via API: Datadog, Splunk, your collectors. Read-only by default. No agents, no code changes, no infrastructure changes. Your setup stays exactly as it is.

## 2. Build context

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-generic-2.svg" alt="Build context from your data" />
</Frame>

Tero analyzes your telemetry and builds [context](/context/overview). Billions of raw logs compress into thousands of distinct log events. Each one is understood: what it represents, which service produces it, whether anyone queries it. Services, dependencies, and failure scenarios get connected into a graph.

This is how Tero knows what's waste and what matters.

## 3. Review rules

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-generic-3.svg" alt="Review and approve rules" />
</Frame>

Tero surfaces [rules](/data-quality/overview): specific statements about what's wrong and why. This field duplicates that one. This log is a health check firing 86,400 times a day. This debug statement shipped to production.

Rules are organized by [category](/data-quality/overview#categories): redundant attributes, health checks, leftover debugging, verbose payloads, PII leakage. You review with examples from your actual data. Approve what you agree with.

## 4. Enforce

Approved rules get [enforced](/data-quality/enforcement/overview). You choose where:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="In your provider" defaultOpen>
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-generic-4-in-provider.svg" alt="Configure your provider" />
    </Frame>

    Configure exclusion filters, routing rules, or transformations directly via API. No deployment required. Fully reversible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In your code">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-generic-4-in-code.svg" alt="Fix it in your code" />
    </Frame>

    Open PRs to fix instrumentation at the source, or create tickets for engineers to handle on their schedule.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="In your infrastructure">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-generic-4-in-infrastructure.svg" alt="Execute at the edge" />
    </Frame>

    Execute rules at the [edge](/edge/overview) before data leaves your network. Drop-in replacements for collectors you already run.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Tero monitors for regression. If a problem resurfaces, Tero catches it. Problems you fix stay fixed.
