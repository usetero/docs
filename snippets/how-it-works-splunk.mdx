## 1. Connect

  <img src="/images/how-it-works-splunk-1.svg" alt="Connect to Splunk" />
</Frame>

Tero connects to Splunk via REST API using an [authentication token](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/CreateAuthTokens). Works with both Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise. Read-only by default. No agents to deploy, no code changes, no infrastructure changes. Your setup stays exactly as it is.

## 2. Build context

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-splunk-2.svg" alt="Understand your data" />
</Frame>

Tero analyzes your telemetry and builds [context](/context/overview). Billions of logs compress into thousands of [log events](/context/log-events). Millions of spans become [trace span patterns](/context/trace-spans). Each is understood: what it represents, when it matters, which service produces it. Services, metrics, failure scenarios, dependencies get connected into a graph.

## 3. Ask questions

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/how-it-works-splunk-3.svg" alt="Ask questions" />
</Frame>

You ask questions, Tero answers. [How much data is waste?](/questions/waste) [Are there data spikes?](/questions/data-spikes) [Is PII leaking?](/questions/pii)

## 4. Take action

Once Tero identifies a problem, you decide what to do.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-splunk-4-in-provider.svg" alt="Configure Splunk" />
    </Frame>

    Tero generates the [transforms.conf and props.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Forwarding/Routeandfilterdatad) configurations to route waste to nullQueue. Apply them to your forwarders or indexers. Waste stops being indexed and doesn't count against your license.

  <Accordion title="In your code">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/how-it-works-splunk-4-in-code.svg" alt="Fix it in your code" />
    </Frame>

    Tero can open a PR with the fix for you to review and merge. Or use Tero as an MCP so developers understand what to change. Or just use the analysis to make changes yourself.
