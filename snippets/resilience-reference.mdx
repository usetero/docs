## Resilience Reference

### Availability

| Component | Target | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Control plane | <Badge color="green">99.9%</Badge> | Multi-zone deployment with automatic failover |
| API | <Badge color="green">99.9%</Badge> | Load balancing across zones |
| Edge | <Badge color="green">Your Control</Badge> | Runs in your infrastructure |
| Status page | <Badge color="green">Public</Badge> | status.usetero.com |

### What Happens When Things Fail

| Scenario | Impact | Why It's Okay |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Control plane unavailable | <Badge color="surface">No Impact</Badge> | Edge uses cached rules, continues filtering |
| Single zone fails | <Badge color="surface">No Impact</Badge> | Automatic failover to another zone |
| Database fails | <Badge color="surface">No Impact</Badge> | Automatic failover to replica |
| Edge proxy fails | <Badge color="surface">No Impact</Badge> | Fails open, passes data through unfiltered |
| AI service unavailable | <Badge color="orange">Degraded</Badge> | New log classification delayed, existing rules work |

### Backups & Recovery

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Backup frequency | Daily, automated |
| Backup retention | 30 days |
| Backup encryption | AES-256 |
| Backup location | Geo-redundant, separate from primary |
| Recovery time | 4 hours for full restoration |
| Recovery point | 24 hours maximum data loss |

### Edge Resilience

| Feature | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|
| Fail-open behavior | Passes data through on any unhandled error |
| Local rule caching | Works without control plane connection |
| Health checks | Exposes endpoints for your monitoring |
| Performance | Typically adds less than 1ms latency |
| Deployment options | Sidecar, pipeline, or centralized |

### Monitoring

| What We Monitor | How |
|----------------|-----|
| Control plane health | Real-time with automated alerts |
| API performance | Error rates, latency, availability |
| Database | Connection health, query performance |
| Infrastructure | GCP Security Command Center |
| Edge health | Health endpoints for your tools |

### Incident Response

| Severity | Response Time | Process |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Critical | <Badge color="green">1 hour</Badge> | On-call engineer notified immediately |
| High | <Badge color="green">4 hours</Badge> | Investigation begins within 4 hours |
| Data incidents | <Badge color="green">24 hours</Badge> | Affected customers notified within 24 hours |
| Post-incident | <Badge color="green">Required</Badge> | All incidents reviewed, improvements implemented |
