<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with read-only access">
    Connect Tero to your observability platform with read-only API permissions. We analyze your telemetry, build a semantic catalog, and show you where the waste is. No infrastructure changes. No risk to production systems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant write access when ready">
    If you want Tero to configure exclusion rules or adjust sampling instead of implementing recommendations yourself, grant write permissions. Scope them however you need. Revoke them anytime.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy edge for maximum savings">
    The edge proxy runs in your infrastructure and filters telemetry before it leaves your network. Most customers start API-only and add edge after they trust the control plane.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Self-host for complete control">
    Run the entire control plane in your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your network. Your compliance boundary. We provide the software, you run it.
