Install the CLI, connect your Datadog account, and see what Tero finds.

## Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash macOS / Linux
curl -sSfL https://sh.usetero.com | sh
```

```bash Homebrew
brew install usetero/tap/tero
```

```bash Windows (Scoop)
scoop bucket add tero https://github.com/usetero/scoop-bucket
scoop install tero
```

```bash Docker
docker pull usetero/tero
```
</CodeGroup>

## Connect

```bash
tero
```

On first run, Tero will:
1. Ask you to authenticate (or create an account)
2. Walk you through connecting your Datadog account (read-only API key)
3. Analyze your data and show you what it found

That's it. After setup, run `tero` anytime to explore waste, check status, or take action.

## What's next

Once analysis completes, Tero can answer your first question: [How much of my data is waste?](/questions/waste/overview)
