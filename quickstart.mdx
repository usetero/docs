Install the CLI, connect your Datadog account, and see what Tero finds.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the CLI">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash curl
    curl -sSfL https://sh.usetero.com | sh
    ```

    ```bash Homebrew
    brew install usetero/tap/tero
    ```

    ```bash Scoop (Windows)
    scoop bucket add tero https://github.com/usetero/scoop-bucket
    scoop install tero
    ```

    ```bash Docker
    docker pull usetero/tero
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your account">
    ```bash
    tero
    ```

    On first run, Tero will:
    1. Ask you to authenticate (or create an account)
    2. Walk you through connecting your Datadog account (read-only API key)
    3. Build context from your telemetry
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask your first question">
    Once analysis completes, you're ready to ask: [How much data is waste?](/questions/waste/getting-started)
    
    That walkthrough will guide you through your first waste analysis, from seeing the number to taking your first action.
