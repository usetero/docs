<Steps>
  <Step title="Install">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash curl
    curl -sSfL https://sh.usetero.com | sh
    ```

    ```bash Homebrew
    brew install usetero/tap/tero
    ```

    ```bash Scoop (Windows)
    scoop bucket add tero https://github.com/usetero/scoop-bucket
    scoop install tero
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect">
    ```bash
    tero
    ```

    Connect your observability platform. Datadog, Splunk, or wherever your data lives. Read-only by default.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See your first policies">
    ```
    /policies
    ```

    Tero surfaces policies organized by type: duplicate fields, health checks, leftover debugging. Pick something obvious. Approve it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="That's it">
    Your first policy is enforced. Explore from here:

    - `/services`, `/logs` to navigate the Master Catalog
    - `@checkout-api` to reference any service
    - Ask naturally: "What's the noisiest service?" "Why is this flagged?"
  </Step>
