    The CLI walks you through everything: authentication, connecting your Datadog account, and discovering your services. Have your Datadog API key and Application key ready — you'll find both under **Organization Settings → API Keys** / **Application Keys** in Datadog.

    Discovery takes about a minute to analyze your services and log patterns.

  <Step title="Explore">
    Once setup finishes, you're in. Ask questions, browse policies, or just look around:

    - `/policies` to see what Tero found
    - `/services`, `/logs` to navigate the Master Catalog
    - `@checkout-api` to reference any service
    - Ask naturally: *"What's the noisiest service?"*
  </Step>
