The Master Catalog is Tero's unified view of all your observability data (services, log events, metrics, traces) across every source you connect.

Not sampling. Not partial visibility. Complete coverage, automatically maintained, semantically understood. Tero knows what each piece of data means, not just its format.

## What Tero understands

For each piece of telemetry, Tero builds understanding across four dimensions:

- **Structure.** Fields, types, formats. What the data looks like.
- **Semantics.** What it means. A `payment_failed` log is a business event, not just a string.
- **Relationships.** Which service emits it. What other events correlate with it. Whether it appears in dashboards or alerts.
- **Usage.** How often it's queried. Whether anyone actually looks at it. What role it plays during incidents.

This is what makes [policy](/policies) generation possible. Without understanding what data means and how it's used, you can only do pattern matching. With it, you can reason about value.

## What's in the catalog

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Services" icon="circle-nodes" href="/master-catalog/services">
    Your infrastructure components: what they do, what they depend on, what telemetry they produce.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Log Events" icon="file-lines" href="/master-catalog/log-events">
    Billions of raw logs compressed into thousands of distinct patterns. Each one understood.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metrics" icon="chart-line" href="/master-catalog/metrics">
    Named measurements with their tags, cardinality, and usage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trace Spans" icon="diagram-subtask" href="/master-catalog/trace-spans">
    The operations that make up your requests.

## How the catalog builds

Connect an [integration](/integrations) (Datadog, Splunk, your OTel collectors) and Tero discovers what's there. Services get cataloged. Log events get identified and grouped. Metrics get mapped. Relationships form between them. You can drill into any of it, see exactly what Tero found and how it's connected.

The catalog updates continuously. New services, new log formats, new errors: they get discovered and added automatically. The goal is complete coverage with zero manual maintenance.

Tero enriches what it finds. It detects that a service is a Rails app and adds known failure patterns. It identifies common error signatures. It notices which events correlate during incidents.

You can refine it too. Correct a misclassification and Tero learns. Add context it couldn't infer. The catalog gets sharper over time.
