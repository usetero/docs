Tero discovers services from your [integrations](/integrations). Each one becomes a hub in the catalog, owning [log events](/master-catalog/log-events), [metrics](/master-catalog/metrics), and [trace spans](/master-catalog/trace-spans), and relating to other services through dependencies.

## What Tero knows

Tero doesn't just import names. It analyzes logs and traces to understand what each service does, what technologies it uses, and how it relates to other services.

<Expandable title="Fields">
  <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
    The service identifier as it appears in your telemetry.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
    What the service does, generated from observed behavior.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="technologies" type="array">
    Languages, frameworks, databases. Inferred from logs and traces.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="dependencies" type="array">
    Other services this one calls or relies on.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="failure_scenarios" type="array">
    Known ways the service fails and what causes them.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="ownership" type="string">
    Team or individual responsible (when available).
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

## Exploring a service

Open any service to see what Tero figured out: description, technologies, dependencies, failure scenarios, log events. Everything connected to that service in the catalog.

## Using in chat

Reference a service with `@` to scope your questions:

```
@checkout why are we seeing elevated error rates?
@payment what are the common failure modes?
@kafka what log events does this produce?
```

Tero pulls in everything connected: the service's description, dependencies, failure scenarios, log events. Your question gets answered with that full context.

## Refining a service

Tero generates descriptions and infers technologies, but you can refine what it knows:

- **Edit descriptions** to add detail Tero couldn't infer
- **Add failure scenarios** your team knows about
- **Note ownership** so Tero knows who to reference

The more you refine, the better the catalog becomes.
