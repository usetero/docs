A log event isn't a log line. It's a pattern that represents thousands or millions of logs that mean the same thing. Tero discovers these patterns from your [integrations](/integrations) and adds them to the catalog.

## Example

Here's a raw log:

```yaml
body: "Payment declined: insufficient funds"
severity: ERROR
attributes:
  order_id: "ORD-12345"
  error_code: "card_declined"
  decline_reason: "insufficient_funds"
```

Tero turns it into a log event:

```yaml
name: card_declined_insufficient_funds
service: checkout
description: A card payment was declined due to insufficient funds.

matchers:
  - field_type: log_attribute
    field_name: error_code
    match_type: exact
    match_value: "card_declined"
  - field_type: log_attribute
    field_name: decline_reason
    match_type: exact
    match_value: "insufficient_funds"
```

These matchers identify 47,000 logs. Each log has different order IDs, timestamps, amounts. But they all match the same attributes: `error_code: card_declined` and `decline_reason: insufficient_funds`. That's the event.

<Expandable title="Fields">
  <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
    A descriptive identifier like `card_declined_insufficient_funds` or `kafka_offset_committed`. Unique within the service.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
    What this event represents and when it fires.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="service" type="string">
    The service that produces this event.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="matchers" type="array">
    Rules that identify which raw logs belong to this event. Combinations of body patterns and attribute conditions.
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="attributes" type="array">
    Fields that vary per instance: order IDs, user IDs, amounts, durations. The data inside each log.
  </ResponseField>
</Expandable>

## Exploring log events

Open any log event to see what Tero learned: the description, matchers, sample logs, classification reasoning. Browse by service or search across all events.

Drill into the matchers to understand exactly which logs this event captures. See sample instances to verify the pattern makes sense.

## Using in chat

Reference a log event with `@` to focus your questions:

```
@payment_declined_insufficient_funds how often does this happen?
@database_connection_timeout what services are affected?
@order_created what's the typical latency?
```

Tero pulls in the event's context: which service owns it, what attributes it has, how it relates to other events. Your question gets answered with that full picture.

## Refining log events

Tero classifies events automatically, but you know your systems better:

- **Reclassify** events that Tero misjudged. That "debug" log might actually matter.
- **Edit descriptions** to add context Tero couldn't infer.
- **Adjust matchers** if an event is capturing the wrong logs.

Every correction improves the catalog.
