# Philosophy

These docs exist to earn trust and build understanding.

The reader is an engineer responsible for observability at their company. Staff SRE, Platform Lead, Director of Infrastructure — the title varies but the situation is consistent. They're accountable for supporting engineering teams and managing a budget that grows faster than they'd like. They've been burned by vendors who overpromised. They've sat through demos that dodged hard questions. They've read marketing copy that said nothing. They're here because something about Tero caught their attention, and now they want to know: is this real?

That's the question the docs answer. Not through claims or persuasion, but through substance. Technical depth that shows we understand the problem. Honest constraints that show we're not hiding anything. Clear explanations that respect their intelligence.

## The distinction from marketing

The website, blog posts, and sales materials have a different job. They earn attention. The reader hasn't committed yet, so there's a persuasive element — you're making a case for why they should care.

The docs assume they already care. They've given us their time. Now we have to not waste it.

This means: get to the point faster. More technical depth, less framing. Fewer "why this matters" sections, more "how this works." Honesty about limitations becomes even more important because they'll find out anyway. The confidence is quieter — we're explaining, not pitching.

The docs don't try to convince anyone of anything. They demonstrate what Tero is and how it works. If the product is good and the explanation is clear, the reader draws their own conclusions.

## What earns trust

Show real technology, not buzzwords. Mention Hyperscan, explain semantic compression, show how the context graph works. Readers can tell when something is real.

Be clear about constraints. What doesn't Tero do yet? Where are the edges? Honesty about current scope says we're not trying to trick anyone.

Respect intelligence. No hand-holding, no over-explaining, no corporate speak. Write like you're explaining to a peer.

Make the incentives legible. No per-GB pricing. No storing their data. No lock-in. They control their infrastructure. The business model should make sense to them.

## What breaks trust

Anything that makes us feel like another vendor. Per-GB pricing or volume-based anything. "Send us your data" without clarity about what happens to it. Lock-in signals — proprietary agents, special query languages, data formats they can't escape. Features that don't exist yet documented as if they do. Corporate speak. AI that's just marketing.

They've seen all of this before. The moment we sound like a vendor doing a sales pitch, they stop reading.

## The feeling

The docs should feel like they were written by engineers who care about craft. Technical depth without pretension. Sophisticated but not complicated.

Care without coddling. Respect their intelligence. Don't add disclaimers everywhere. Write like you're explaining to a peer who's short on time but wants to understand deeply.

Substance without showing off. Show engineering depth — mention the technologies, explain the trade-offs, share real numbers. But never say "we're the best" or "revolutionary." Let the work speak.

Simple without simplistic. The architecture is sophisticated. Don't dumb it down. But present it so it feels inevitable — of course it works this way. Progressive disclosure: simple on the surface, depth available when they want it.

Honest about limits. What do we not do yet? Where are we headed? This builds trust. It says we're building something real, not performing.

The best docs feel like a smart engineer inside your company wrote them for you. Not sales material. Not marketing copy. Just: here's how this works, here's why it matters, here's how to use it.
