# Documentation TODOs

- [ ] Go through all pages and add links where relevant. Pages were written before we had all the links or understood where to link. Ensure concepts are properly linked (Master Catalog, policies, integrations, edge, etc.)
- [ ] Review Edge docs for alignment with policy terminology
- [ ] Update integration pages to reference policies instead of rules
