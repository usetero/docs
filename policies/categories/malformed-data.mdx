Logs that aren't logs. Binary data, corrupted output, unparseable strings. They convey nothing and cost you money.

## Why it happens

Applications crash mid-write. Binary protocols get routed to text log pipelines. Encoding mismatches produce garbage. A process dumps core and the output ends up in your logs. Sometimes it's a misconfigured logger, sometimes it's a bug, sometimes it's just bad luck.

These aren't edge cases. In a large enough system, something is always emitting garbage somewhere.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "image-processor",
      "body": "\u0089PNG\r\n\u001a\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\rIHDR..."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    Dropped entirely. No value to preserve.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a policy to drop this specific log event:

```yaml
id: drop-png-binary-image-processor
name: Drop PNG binary data from image-processor
description: PNG image data routed to log pipeline. Not parseable, not queryable.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: image-processor
    - log_field: body
      regex: "^\\x89PNG\\r\\n"
  keep: none
```

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge" horizontal>
  Drop malformed logs before they reach your provider. No point paying to store garbage.
</Card>

There's no "fix at source" for most malformed data. It's usually a symptom of something breaking, not a logging decision someone made.

## How it works

Tero evaluates each [log event](/master-catalog/log-events) in your Master Catalog. It looks at the content structure and whether the log is parseable.

When Tero finds malformed data (binary content, unparseable strings, corrupted output), it generates a policy for that specific pattern. You approve the policy, and it gets enforced.
