Logs that aren't logs. Binary data, corrupted output, unparseable strings. They convey nothing and cost you money.

Applications crash mid-write. Binary protocols get routed to text log pipelines. Encoding mismatches produce garbage. In a large enough system, something is always emitting garbage somewhere.

## Example

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge" horizontal>
  Drop malformed logs before they reach your provider. No point paying to store garbage.
</Card>

There's no "fix at source" for most malformed data. It's a symptom of something breaking, not a logging decision someone made.
