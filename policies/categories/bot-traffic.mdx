Requests from crawlers, scrapers, and automated scanners. Googlebot indexing your pages, security scanners probing endpoints, Slack unfurling links. Real traffic, but not your users.

For public-facing services, bot traffic can be 30-50% of total volume. You're paying to store logs from Googlebot, not your customers.

Tero can drop entire request traces, not just individual logs. If a request has a user-agent field at the entry point and a correlation ID (like `request_id` or `trace_id`), Tero drops all logs from that request. The bot is identified once, and every downstream log follows.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single log">
    A standalone log with a user-agent field:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Before">
        ```json
        {
          "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
          "service.name": "marketing-site",
          "http.method": "GET",
          "http.target": "/pricing",
          "http.status_code": 200,
          "http.user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1)"
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="After">
        Dropped entirely.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ```yaml
    id: drop-bot-traffic-marketing-site
    name: Drop bot traffic from marketing-site
    description: Drop requests from known crawlers and scrapers.
    log:
      match:
        - resource_attribute: service.name
          exact: marketing-site
        - log_attribute: http.user_agent
          regex: "(Googlebot|bingbot|Slackbot|AhrefsBot|facebookexternalhit)"
      keep: none
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Correlated request">
    A request that spans multiple services, identified by `request_id`:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Before">
        ```json
        // Entry point - has user-agent
        {"service.name": "api-gateway", "request_id": "req_abc123", "http.user_agent": "Googlebot/2.1", "path": "/products"}
        
        // Downstream - no user-agent, same request_id
        {"service.name": "product-service", "request_id": "req_abc123", "event": "fetch_products"}
        {"service.name": "cache-service", "request_id": "req_abc123", "event": "cache_miss"}
        {"service.name": "database", "request_id": "req_abc123", "event": "query_executed"}
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="After">
        All four logs dropped. The bot was identified at the entry point, and every log with that `request_id` follows.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ```yaml
    id: drop-bot-traffic-correlated
    name: Drop bot traffic with correlated logs
    description: Drop entire request trace when entry point is identified as bot traffic.
    log:
      match:
        - log_attribute: http.user_agent
          regex: "(Googlebot|bingbot|Slackbot|AhrefsBot)"
      correlation:
        field: request_id
      keep: none
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge" horizontal>
  Drop bot traffic logs before they reach your provider. Immediate volume reduction.
</Card>

Bot traffic is external noise. Your application didn't decide to log these requests. Dropping at the edge is the right place.

## How it works

Tero identifies bot traffic through the user-agent field. Bots usually self-identify: `Googlebot`, `bingbot`, `Slackbot`, and hundreds of others announce themselves.

If a log event has both a user-agent field and a correlation ID (like `request_id` or `trace_id`), Tero can drop the entire request trace, not just the entry point. The initial HTTP handler logs the user-agent, but downstream database queries, cache lookups, and service calls don't. Correlation lets you drop all of them.
