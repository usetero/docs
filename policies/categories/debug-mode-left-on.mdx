A service running at DEBUG log level in production. Someone enabled verbose logging to investigate an issue, then forgot to turn it off. Now you're getting 10x the logs you need.

## Why it happens

An engineer enables DEBUG logging to investigate an issue. The issue gets resolved. The engineer moves on. The log level stays at DEBUG. Days pass. Weeks pass. The service keeps emitting massive volumes of logs nobody reads.

This is common. Log level changes often happen through environment variables or config files that don't go through normal code review. There's no reminder to switch back.

## How Tero detects it

This isn't a per-log-event analysis. Tero looks at service-level patterns: a sudden spike in DEBUG logs that persists beyond a reasonable troubleshooting window.

If a service has been emitting elevated DEBUG volume for days, something's probably wrong. Either debug mode was left on, or there's a misconfiguration that needs attention.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    A service emitting thousands of DEBUG logs per minute:
    ```json
    {"severity_text": "DEBUG", "body": "Entering getUserById", "service.name": "user-service"}
    {"severity_text": "DEBUG", "body": "Cache miss for user 12345", "service.name": "user-service"}
    {"severity_text": "DEBUG", "body": "Querying database", "service.name": "user-service"}
    {"severity_text": "DEBUG", "body": "Query took 3ms", "service.name": "user-service"}
    {"severity_text": "DEBUG", "body": "Exiting getUserById", "service.name": "user-service"}
    ```
    This pattern repeating for every request, for days.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    Log level set back to INFO. Only meaningful events logged.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This isn't a policy you deploy to filter logs. It's a configuration problem that needs to be fixed at the source.

## Recommended enforcement

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Create tickets" icon="ticket" href="/policies/enforcement/create-tickets">
    Alert the service owner that debug mode is still enabled.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open PRs" icon="code-pull-request" href="/policies/enforcement/open-prs">
    If log levels are config-as-code, change it directly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge">
    Temporary blocking if the issue persists. Auto-reverts.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Start with tickets. If a service has had debug mode on for 48+ hours with no response, edge blocking can get attention. But the real fix is changing the configuration.

## How it works

Tero tracks log volume and severity patterns per service. When DEBUG-level volume spikes and stays elevated for longer than typical troubleshooting (hours, not minutes), it's flagged.

The signal is time. DEBUG logs during an active incident are normal. DEBUG logs that persist for days after the incident ended are a forgotten configuration.
