Large data blobs embedded in logs. Full HTTP response bodies, entire database records, massive stack traces. Fields that add kilobytes to every log event.

One log event with a 10KB response body, fired 100,000 times a day, is 1GB of storage. For one log pattern. In one service.

## Example

  <Tab title="Response body">

      <Tab title="Before">
        ```json

        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="After">
        ```json
        {
          "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",

          "error.message": "Connection refused"
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    The full stack trace is preserved in your tracing backend. The log doesn't need a copy.

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Open PRs" icon="code-pull-request" href="/policies/enforcement/open-prs" horizontal>
  Fix at the source. The developer who added this logging should decide what to keep.
</Card>

Unlike infrastructure noise, excessive payloads are usually intentional logging decisions. The right fix is often to log less in the first place. The developer knows whether that response body is actually useful.

## How it works

Tero flags fields that are obviously too large. Full HTTP response bodies, entire serialized objects, 500-line stack traces. These aren't borderline cases - they're kilobytes of data embedded in every log. Obviously wrong.
