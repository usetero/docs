Large data blobs embedded in logs. Full HTTP response bodies, entire database records, massive stack traces. Fields that add kilobytes to every log event.

## Why it happens

Developers log context for debugging. Sometimes that context is a full API response. Or an entire user object. Or a 500-line stack trace. It helps when investigating issues, but it ships to production and stays there forever.

One log event with a 10KB response body, fired 100,000 times a day, is 1GB of storage. For one log pattern. In one service.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "order-service",
      "event": "order.created",
      "order_id": "ORD-12345",
      "http.response.body": "{\"id\":\"ORD-12345\",\"items\":[{\"sku\":\"SKU-001\",\"name\":\"Widget Pro\",\"quantity\":2,\"price\":29.99},{\"sku\":\"SKU-002\",\"name\":\"Gadget Plus\",\"quantity\":1,\"price\":49.99}],\"shipping\":{\"method\":\"express\",\"address\":{\"street\":\"123 Main St\",\"city\":\"Seattle\",\"state\":\"WA\",\"zip\":\"98101\",\"country\":\"US\"}},\"billing\":{\"method\":\"card\",\"last4\":\"4242\"},\"totals\":{\"subtotal\":109.97,\"shipping\":12.99,\"tax\":10.45,\"total\":133.41}}"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "order-service",
      "event": "order.created",
      "order_id": "ORD-12345"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a scoped policy for each service where excessive payloads exist:

```yaml
id: remove-response-body-order-service
name: Remove response body from order-service
description: Drop full HTTP response body. The order_id is preserved for lookup.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: order-service
    - log_attribute: event
      exact: order.created
  transform:
    remove:
      - log_attribute: http.response.body
```

<Tip>
  Review these carefully. Some teams intentionally log full payloads for compliance or debugging. Discuss with the service owner before approving.

## Recommended enforcement

  Fix at the source. The developer who added this logging should decide what to keep.
</Card>

Unlike infrastructure noise, excessive payloads are usually intentional logging decisions. The right fix is often to log less in the first place, not to strip fields at the edge.

## How it works

Tero identifies excessive payloads by analyzing field sizes across your [Master Catalog](/master-catalog). Fields that consistently exceed a size threshold (like `http.response.body` or `request.payload`) are flagged.

Tero also checks whether these large fields are ever queried. A 10KB field that nobody searches is a clear candidate for removal. A 10KB field that appears in dashboards might be intentional.
