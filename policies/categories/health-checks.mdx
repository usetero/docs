Logs from health check endpoints. Kubernetes probes hitting `/health`, load balancers pinging `/ready`, synthetic monitors verifying uptime. Infrastructure checking if your service is alive, not real user traffic.

Every production service needs health checks. Each check generates a log. Multiply by pods, by check frequency, by services. A small cluster can generate millions of health check logs per day. They tell you nothing you don't already know.

Only successful probes are dropped. Failed health checks have debugging value - a `503` to `/health` tells you when and why your service was unhealthy. Those stay.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "checkout-api",
      "http.method": "GET",
      "http.target": "/health",
      "http.status_code": 200,
      "http.user_agent": "kube-probe/1.28"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    Dropped entirely.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a scoped policy for each service where this pattern exists:

```yaml
id: drop-health-checks-checkout-api
name: Drop health check logs from checkout-api
description: Drop Kubernetes probe requests to health endpoints.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
    - log_attribute: http.target
      regex: "^/(health|ready|live|ping)"
    - log_attribute: http.status_code
      exact: "200"
  keep: none
```

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge" horizontal>
  Drop health check logs before they reach your provider. Immediate volume reduction.
</Card>

Health checks are infrastructure noise generated by Kubernetes and load balancers, not your application logic. Dropping at the edge is the right place.

## How it works

Tero identifies health check logs by looking at request patterns: common paths (`/health`, `/ready`, `/live`, `/ping`, `/healthz`), known probe user agents (`kube-probe`, `ELB-HealthChecker`), and successful status codes.
