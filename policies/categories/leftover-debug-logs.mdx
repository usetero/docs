Debug statements that obviously weren't meant to ship. `console.log("here")`, `print("WTF")`, `logger.debug("asdf")`. Developer breadcrumbs that made it to production by accident.

This category is strict. We're not talking about legitimate DEBUG-level logging. We're talking about obviously accidental statements that any engineer would recognize as mistakes: severity DEBUG or TRACE with throwaway messages like "got here", "hello world", "WTF", "asdf", bare variable dumps like `"user: {user}"`.

The test: would any engineer look at this and immediately know it's a mistake?

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "checkout-api",
      "severity_text": "DEBUG",
      "body": "got here lol"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    Dropped entirely.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a policy to drop this specific log event:

```yaml
id: drop-debug-got-here-checkout-api
name: Drop got-here debug log from checkout-api
description: Accidental debug statement that shipped to production.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
    - log_field: body
      exact: "got here lol"
  keep: none
```

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Open PRs" icon="code-pull-request" href="/policies/enforcement/open-prs" horizontal>
  Fix at the source. These are code mistakes. Remove them from the codebase.
</Card>

Unlike most categories, leftover debug logs should be fixed in code. The log statement shouldn't exist. Opening a PR to remove it fixes the problem permanently.

## How it works

Tero looks for obvious debug patterns: DEBUG/TRACE severity combined with throwaway message content. Messages that contain common debug phrases ("got here", "testing", "WTF") or appear to be accidental (random characters, bare variable names) are flagged.

Conservative by design. Tero only flags logs that are unambiguously mistakes. Legitimate debug logging, even if verbose, isn't flagged.
