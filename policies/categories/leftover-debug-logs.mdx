Debug statements that obviously weren't meant to ship. `console.log("here")`, `print("WTF")`, `logger.debug("asdf")`. Developer breadcrumbs that made it to production by accident.

## Why it happens

Engineers add throwaway debug statements while developing. Most get removed before merge. Some don't. Code review catches obvious ones, but quick fixes under pressure slip through.

Nobody intends to ship these. But every codebase has them.

## What counts as leftover

This category is strict. We're not talking about legitimate DEBUG-level logging. We're talking about *obviously* accidental statements that any engineer would recognize as mistakes.

**Leftover debug logs:**
- Severity DEBUG or TRACE with throwaway messages
- Messages like "got here", "hello world", "WTF", "asdf", "test", "xxx", "debugging"
- Bare variable dumps: "user: {user}"
- Placeholder messages that were never replaced

**Not leftover debug logs:**
- Legitimate DEBUG-level logging with meaningful content
- Verbose logging that's intentionally enabled
- TODO comments (those belong in code review, not log analysis)

The test: **would any engineer look at this and immediately know it's a mistake?**

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "checkout-api",
      "severity_text": "DEBUG",
      "body": "got here lol"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    Dropped entirely.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a policy to drop this specific log event:

```yaml
id: drop-debug-got-here-checkout-api
name: Drop "got here" debug log from checkout-api
description: Accidental debug statement that shipped to production.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
    - log_field: body
      exact: "got here lol"
  keep: none
```

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Open PRs" icon="code-pull-request" href="/policies/enforcement/open-prs" horizontal>
  Fix at the source. These are code mistakes—remove them from the codebase.
</Card>

Unlike most categories, leftover debug logs should be fixed in code. The log statement shouldn't exist. Opening a PR to remove it fixes the problem permanently and cleans up the codebase.

## How it works

Tero evaluates each log event and looks for obvious debug patterns: DEBUG/TRACE severity combined with throwaway message content. Messages that contain common debug phrases ("got here", "testing", "WTF") or appear to be accidental (random characters, bare variable names) are flagged.

This is conservative by design. Tero only flags logs that are unambiguously mistakes. Legitimate debug logging—even if verbose—isn't flagged.
