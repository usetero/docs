Debug statements that weren't meant to ship. `console.log("here")`, `print(f"DEBUG: {x}")`, `TODO: remove this`. Developer breadcrumbs that made it to production.

## Why it happens

Engineers add debug statements while developing. Most get removed before merge. Some don't. Code review catches obvious ones, but `logger.debug()` calls blend in. Over time, they accumulate.

Nobody intends to ship debug logs. But every codebase has them.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "service.name": "checkout-api",
      "severity_text": "DEBUG",
      "body": "got here lol"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    Dropped entirely.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a policy to drop this specific log event:

```yaml
id: drop-debug-got-here-checkout-api
name: Drop "got here" debug log from checkout-api
description: Debug statement that shipped to production. Not used in any dashboard or alert.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
    - log_field: body
      exact: "got here lol"
  keep: none
```

## Recommended enforcement

  Fix at the source. These are code mistakes, not infrastructure decisions.
</Card>

Unlike most policy types, leftover debug logs should be fixed in code. The log statement shouldn't exist. Opening a PR to remove it fixes the problem permanently.

## How it works

Tero evaluates each [log event](/master-catalog/log-events) in your Master Catalog. It looks at the content, the severity, the service context, and whether the log appears in any dashboards or alerts.

A log with `severity_text: DEBUG` might be intentional. But a log that says "got here lol", has DEBUG severity, and never appears in any dashboard or alert? That's clearly a debug statement that shipped by accident. Tero flags it and generates a policy you can approve or dismiss.
