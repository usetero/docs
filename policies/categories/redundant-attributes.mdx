Two fields with the same value. Literal duplicates. Each one adds bytes to every log.

Different parts of your stack add the same information under different names:

- Your application logs `time`, your collector adds `@timestamp`
- Your SDK logs `level`, the OTel exporter adds `severity_text`
- Your service logs `host`, your agent adds `hostname`

Nobody planned this. It just accumulated.

## Example

The following log has three duplicate pairs: `time` and `@timestamp`, `level` and `severity_text`, `host` and `hostname`. Same values, different names.

  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "level": "ERROR",
      "severity_text": "ERROR",
      "host": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "hostname": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "message": "Connection timeout"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "severity_text": "ERROR",
      "hostname": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "message": "Connection timeout"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a scoped policy:

```yaml
id: remove-redundant-fields-checkout-api
name: Remove redundant fields from checkout-api
description: Drop duplicate fields that contain the same data as their canonical equivalents.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
  transform:
    remove:
      - log_attribute: time
      - log_attribute: level
      - log_attribute: host
```
## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge" horizontal>
  Drop the redundant field before data leaves your network. Immediate savings, no code changes.
</Card>

These fields come from multiple places: agents, collectors, SDKs. Not your application code. You often can't fix at the source. The edge is where you have control.

## How it works

Tero compares field values across your logs. Exact string matches get flagged. Semantic equivalents too: `level: 9` and `severity_text: INFO` are the same thing, so one gets removed.

Fields that look similar but contain different values aren't flagged. If `time` is UTC and `@timestamp` is local time, that's not redundant. They're different representations. Same with `request_id` and `trace_id`. Related but distinct identifiers.

Only true duplicates. Tero keeps the canonical field (usually the more standard name like `@timestamp` or `severity_text`) and removes the duplicate.
