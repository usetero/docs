Two fields with the same value. Literal duplicates. You're paying to store the same data twice.

## Why it happens

Different parts of your stack add the same information under different names:

- Your application logs `time`, your collector adds `@timestamp`
- Your SDK logs `level`, the OTel exporter adds `severity_text`
- Your service logs `host`, your agent adds `hostname`

Nobody planned this. It just accumulated.

## What counts as redundant

The test: **do these fields contain the same information?**

**Redundant:**
- `time` and `@timestamp` with identical values
- `level` and `severity_text` that map to the same thing (`ERROR` = `ERROR`, `9` = `INFO`)
- `host` and `hostname` with the same value
- `service` and `service.name` pointing to the same string

**Not redundant:**
- `time` in UTC and `@timestamp` in local time—different representations
- `request_id` and `trace_id`—related but different identifiers
- Fields that are similar but not semantically identical

Tero only flags true duplicates where the values match exactly or map to the same meaning.

## Example

The following log has three duplicate pairs: `time` and `@timestamp`, `level` and `severity_text`, `host` and `hostname`. Same values, different names.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "level": "ERROR",
      "severity_text": "ERROR",
      "host": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "hostname": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "message": "Connection timeout"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "severity_text": "ERROR",
      "hostname": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "message": "Connection timeout"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a scoped policy:

```yaml
id: remove-redundant-fields-checkout-api
name: Remove redundant fields from checkout-api
description: Drop duplicate fields that contain the same data as their canonical equivalents.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
  transform:
    remove:
      - log_attribute: time
      - log_attribute: level
      - log_attribute: host
```

<Tip>
  Redundant attributes usually come from collectors and agents. Apply these policies org-wide—if a field is redundant in one service, it's probably redundant everywhere.
</Tip>

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/policies/enforcement/edge" horizontal>
  Drop the redundant field before data leaves your network. Immediate savings, no code changes.
</Card>

These fields are typically added by agents and collectors, not your application code. Fixing at the source would mean reconfiguring your entire observability stack. Dropping at the edge is simpler.

## How it works

Tero analyzes every log event and compares field values. When two fields contain identical values consistently—exact string matches, timestamps that differ only in format, numeric fields with the same value—they're flagged as redundant.

Tero keeps the canonical field (usually the more standard name like `@timestamp` or `severity_text`) and removes the duplicate.
