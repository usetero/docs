Drop, sample, or transform telemetry before it leaves your infrastructure. No code changes, no provider configuration.

<Note>
This is the most common enforcement method. Most [policy categories](/policies/categories) recommend it.
</Note>

## How it works

[Tero Edge](/edge) runs in your infrastructure as a proxy. It periodically syncs with the Tero control plane to fetch policies and applies them in real time.

## Setup

Deploy the proxy alongside your existing telemetry pipeline:

## Example

Tero identifies that `checkout-api` is emitting 2.3 million health check logs per day. Kubernetes probes hit `/health` every 10 seconds on every pod. The logs have never been queried and don't appear in any dashboard or alert.

You approve the policy and select "Enforce at edge." The policy:

```yaml
id: drop-health-checks-checkout-api
name: Drop health check logs from checkout-api
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
    - log_attribute: http.target
      regex: "^/(health|ready|live)"
    - log_attribute: http.status_code
      exact: "200"
  keep: none
```

The policy syncs to Edge within seconds. Edge begins dropping logs that match: requests to `checkout-api` on health check paths with status code `200`. Failed health checks (non-200) still flow through since those have debugging value.

Your data quality dashboard updates in real time. You see the volume from `checkout-api` drop immediately. If something goes wrong, disable the policy and it's removed on the next sync. Logs flow normally again.

## When to use

Enforce at edge works best when:

- You want immediate impact without code changes
- The waste is infrastructure noise (health checks, bot traffic, tool metadata)
- You need to reduce costs quickly while planning a permanent fix
- You want to block temporarily and revert easily
