Eliminating waste once is a project. Tracking it continuously is how you prove value and maintain quality over time.

## Observe impact

Tero watches your data. When waste stops flowing, we notice. Recommendations auto-resolve based on observed impact, not manual confirmation.

You don't have to curate. You don't have to close tickets. The system knows when it worked.

This is the foundation of tracking. Every action you take has measurable impact, and Tero connects the dots automatically.

## Dashboards

See waste trends over time, by service, by team. Understand where you've improved and where new waste is emerging.

Dashboards answer questions like:
- How much have we reduced waste this quarter?
- Which teams are improving? Which are regressing?
- Where is new waste coming from?
- What's the cost impact of our efforts?

## Alerts

Get notified when waste spikes or when you regress. Catch new instrumentation that's producing junk before it accumulates.

Configure alerts for:
- Waste percentage exceeding a threshold
- New high-volume waste appearing
- Teams falling below their quality targets
- Unusual patterns that need attention

## Reports

Share progress with leadership. Show cost reduction over time. Justify the work and the tooling.

Reports translate technical progress into business impact:
- Cost savings, actual dollars
- Percentage reduction over time
- Comparison across teams and services
- Trend lines showing continuous improvement

When finance asks where the observability budget went, you have a complete breakdown. When leadership asks what the platform team delivered, you have numbers.

## The loop

Tracking isn't a separate activity. It's the feedback loop that makes everything else work:

1. Find waste
2. Take action
3. Observe impact
4. Adjust approach
5. Repeat

The better your tracking, the faster you learn what works. The faster you learn, the more you can automate. The more you automate, the more time you have for the nuanced stuff.

This is how waste management becomes a discipline, not a project.
