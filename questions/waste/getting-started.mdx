Now that you've [installed the CLI and connected your account](/quickstart), let's walk through your first waste analysis.

You asked the question. Tero answered with a number: what percentage is waste, what it costs annually, broken down by service. Now let's dig in.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the worst offender">
    ```
    What's the worst offender?
    ```

    Tero shows the service with the highest waste, either by cost or percentage. You'll see every log event from that service, classified and costed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the safest waste">
    ```
    What's the safest to drop?
    ```

    Tero shows the lowest risk waste: high confidence, obvious, easy to verify. Categories like junk and debug output. Logs that should never have been in production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand why">
    ```
    Why?
    ```

    Tero explains the reasoning: what the event is, why it's classified as waste, severity level, query history, who owns the service. The same context you'd use to make the call yourself.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drop it">
    ```
    Drop it
    ```

    Tero generates a policy and applies it. You just eliminated your first waste.

    From here, review more categories, enable auto-apply for ones you trust, or dig into specific services. See [Taking action](/questions/waste/taking-action) for the full workflow.
