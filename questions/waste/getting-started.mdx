Once Tero has built context from your telemetry, you can start asking questions. Here's a walkthrough of your first waste analysis.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask the question">
    ```
    How much of my data is waste?
    ```

    Tero analyzes your telemetry and returns a number: what percentage is waste, what it costs annually, broken down by service.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the worst offender">
    ```
    What's the worst offending service?
    ```

    Tero shows the service with the highest waste, by cost or percentage. You'll see every log event from that service, classified and costed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the safest waste">
    ```
    What's the safest waste to drop?
    ```

    Tero shows the lowest risk waste: high confidence, obvious, easy to verify. Categories like junk and debug output. Logs that should never have been in production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand why">
    ```
    Why is this waste?
    ```

    Tero explains the reasoning: what the event is, why it's classified as waste, severity level, query history, who owns the service. The same context you'd use to make the call yourself.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take action">
    ```
    Drop it
    ```

    Tero generates a policy and applies it. You just eliminated your first waste.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Most teams find 40-70% of their telemetry is waste. Not because they're doing something wrong, but because no one had the tools to see it until now.
