You've found waste. Now eliminate it.

Every waste recommendation becomes a [policy](/edge/policy-reference/log-filter). Don't let the word intimidate you. Policies are just simple, atomic expressions of how to remove waste. Drop this event. Sample that one. Trim this attribute. Each policy does one thing.

Why atomic? Because monolithic pipeline configurations break down at scale. We learned this building Vector.dev. Policies fix that. They're composable, auditable, and designed for thousands of rules.

## Review

Every recommendation includes the reasoning: what the log event is, why it's classified as waste, what the impact would be. You can see exactly why Tero made the call.

If your context differs, adjust the classification. Tero learns from your feedback.

New waste surfaces as unreviewed so you're not re-evaluating the same things. As you review, you build a clear picture of what's valuable and what isn't.

## Action

Once you've reviewed, choose what to do. Multiple options, not mutually exclusive. Start simple, expand as you build trust.

### Ignore

Skip it. Maybe you disagree with the classification. Maybe it's not the right time. Maybe you want to watch it for a while first.

That's fine. Tero won't nag you. Ignored recommendations stay ignored until you revisit them.

### Do it yourself

You don't have to use Tero's enforcement at all. Take the findings and act on them however you want: remove the instrumentation from your code, configure your existing tools, update your OTel Collector config, open a ticket for the owning team.

Tero observes your data volume. When the waste stops flowing, we notice and auto-resolve the recommendation. No manual curation required.

This is a fine place to start. But a caution: when you can truly find all waste (and we mean all of it), you'll surface thousands of recommendations. Distracting engineers with thousands of cleanup tasks isn't a great use of their time. If Tero becomes "ugh, another waste ticket," you've lost. Consider automation for the obvious stuff.

### Agentless

Push exclusion rules directly to your observability provider. Datadog, Splunk, others. Nothing to deploy, nothing to change in your infrastructure. Tero configures it via API.

This is the fastest path to impact. But providers have limits. They weren't designed for thousands of exclusion rules at scale (that requires intentional design with something like Hyperscan). Good starting point, but you'll hit a ceiling.

### Distributions

Our builds of popular tools with Tero's policy engine baked in. Always up to date with upstream. Same config you're already using, new capabilities. Swap it in, point it at your policies, done. Policies execute at the source, before data leaves your infrastructure.

## Scale

Taking action yourself is fine for getting started. But this needs to scale beyond you.

### Sync to git

Policies can sync to a git repository. Push to a folder, open pull requests, merge to main. PRs can be the approval flow itself if that fits your workflow.

Version control, audit history, review before apply. Integrate with your existing CI/CD.

### Automate by category

Not every recommendation needs manual review. Categories map to confidence levels. Configure automation per category:

- **Auto-apply** for categories you trust (junk, debug output). No review, immediate enforcement.
- **Require approval** for categories that need judgment (sampling, trimming).
- **Route to teams** for categories that should be owned by service owners.

Start conservative. As you build trust, dial up automation.

### Push to teams

You don't want to be the gatekeeper. And you can't just remove other engineers' data without their input.

Push ownership to service teams:
- **Team views** show each team their services, their waste, their costs
- **Ownership assignment** ties services to teams, rolls up waste by owner
- **Review workflows** let engineers approve changes to their own services

This shifts the conversation from "platform team says drop this" to "here's what your service costs, you decide."

### Set quality SLOs

Now that you can quantify waste, you can set standards. Integrate with your SLO systems. Set targets per service, per team, org-wide.

This is cultural change. You're not chasing engineers with cleanup requests. You're setting the standard and giving them the tools to meet it. Waste becomes a metric like any other, something teams own and improve.
