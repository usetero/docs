Tero shows you what's waste and why. This page covers how to act on it.

## Review

Every recommendation includes the reasoning: what the log event is, why it's classified as waste, the cost, query history, who owns the service. You see exactly why Tero made the call.

If you disagree, adjust the classification. Tero learns from your feedback. New waste surfaces as unreviewed so you're not re-evaluating the same things.

## Act

Once you've reviewed, choose how to eliminate it. These options aren't mutually exclusive. Start simple, expand as you build trust.

### Do it yourself

Take the findings and act however you want. Remove the instrumentation from your code, configure your existing tools, open a ticket for the owning team. Tero observes your data volume. When the waste stops flowing, the recommendation auto-resolves.

### Configure your provider

Push exclusion rules directly to Datadog, Splunk, or other providers via API. Nothing to deploy, nothing to change in your infrastructure. This is the fastest path to impact.

Providers have limits on exclusion rules. Good starting point, but you may hit a ceiling at scale.

### Deploy policies

For scale beyond what providers support, Tero generates [policies](/edge/policy-reference/log-filter). Policies are simple, atomic rules: drop this event, sample that one, trim this attribute. Each policy does one thing.

Why atomic? Because monolithic pipeline configurations break down at scale. Policies are composable, auditable, and designed for thousands of rules.

You choose where to run them:

## Scale

Acting yourself is fine for getting started. But this needs to scale beyond you.

### Sync to git

Policies can sync to a git repository. Push to a folder, open pull requests, merge to main. Version control, audit history, review before apply.

### Automate by category

Not every recommendation needs manual review. Categories map to confidence levels:

- **Auto-apply** for categories you trust (junk, debug output). No review, immediate enforcement.
- **Require approval** for categories that need judgment (sampling, trimming).
- **Route to teams** for categories that should be owned by service owners.

Start conservative. Dial up automation as you build trust.

### Push to teams

You don't want to be the gatekeeper. And you can't remove other engineers' data without their input.

Push ownership to service teams. Team views show each team their services, their waste, their costs. Engineers approve changes to their own services. The conversation shifts from "platform says drop this" to "here's what your service costs, you decide."

### Set quality SLOs

Now that you can quantify waste, you can set standards. Set targets per service, per team, org-wide. Waste becomes a metric like any other, something teams own and improve.
