<BetaCallout />

A debug log in hot-path middleware. A metric tag that explodes cardinality. An error cascade that floods your systems. You wake up to a cost spike, trace it back to a change from three days ago, and realize the damage is already done.

Tero catches these as they happen. We know what normal looks like for each service, so we detect when something breaks the pattern — volume doubling, new debug output appearing, cardinality jumping.

And we act on it. Alert you in Slack, page the engineer who caused it, open a ticket, block it at the edge. You decide what happens. The spike never reaches your vendor, and the conversation shifts from "why did this cost us?" to "we caught it."
