Credit card numbers, emails, SSNs, access tokens — they end up in logs by accident. A developer logs a request object with sensitive fields. An error message includes data it shouldn't. A third-party library dumps more than you expected.

Tero detects and redacts PII before it leaves your infrastructure. The data never reaches your vendor. No cleanup timeline. No breach notifications. No scrambling to confirm every system that touched it has purged it. The blast radius is zero because the data never left the host.

We show you where it came from so you can fix the source — the log statement leaking emails, the error handler dumping request bodies, the SDK that's more verbose than you realized.
