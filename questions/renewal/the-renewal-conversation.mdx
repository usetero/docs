The renewal conversation happens with finance, leadership, or the vendor. You need to know where you stand and be able to defend it.

## Stay on track

Check anytime. Ask Tero "How is my Datadog renewal looking?" or navigate to your contract page. You see current projection, trend, and whether you're on track.

Set up alerts so you don't have to check. Tero notifies you when:
- Projection crosses your commit threshold
- Burn rate spikes unexpectedly
- A team or service adds significant volume
- You're ahead of or behind pace by a meaningful margin

Alerts go to Slack, email, or the command center. You decide what matters.

## Course correct

When you're off track, Tero shows you why. Which teams, which services, which data types. This connects to the [waste question](/questions/waste). Often the fix is eliminating waste you haven't addressed yet.

Ask Tero "Why am I over budget?" and get a breakdown. Ask "What would get me back on track?" and get specific recommendations.

## Justify what remains

The hard question isn't "what did you cut?" It's "why do you need what's left?"

**What you cut.** Debug logs, health checks, redundant attributes. Concrete categories, concrete savings. The easy part.

**What you kept and why.** These logs map to failure scenarios. These are business events. These have investigative value. The reasoning behind each category.

**Risk if you cut more.** "If you want another 20%, here's what you lose." Mean time to resolution goes up. These failure modes become harder to debug. Compliance requirements aren't met.

**Trend over time.** "We started at 40% waste, now at 8%." A steady state you've worked toward.

When finance asks "can't we cut more?" you have a real answer.

## Generate reports

For the meeting. Ask Tero "Generate a renewal report for Datadog" or schedule recurring reports.

Reports include: cost savings in dollars, trend lines, breakdown by team, projection for next year's commit, justification for what remains. Delivered to inbox, Slack, or exported as PDF.

When someone asks what the platform team delivered, you hand them this.

## Negotiate the next contract

Tero gives you leverage. You know exactly what you need, backed by data. Not a guess, not last year plus 10%.

"Our projected usage is X. Here's the breakdown. Here's why it won't grow faster than Y." You negotiate from knowledge, not hope.
