Tero projects spend on logs, metrics, and traces for vendors you've integrated with. If your contract includes products outside these data types, Tero tracks only what it can see.

<Steps>
  <Step title="See your projection">
    ```
    How is my Datadog renewal looking?
    ```

    Tero responds with your projected spend, when you'll hit your commit, and whether you're on track. If Tero needs contract details, it'll walk you through adding them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your target">
    ```
    I want to keep log spend under $450k
    ```

    Tero compares your target to the projection. If there's a gap, Tero tells you how big it is and whether it's achievable given your current waste. If you're not sure what number to aim for, just ask and Tero will help you set a realistic target based on what it can see.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get a plan">
    ```
    How do I get there?
    ```

    Tero shows you exactly what to do, by when. "Reduce waste to 12% within 6 weeks." Specific services, specific actions, specific deadlines. Every day you wait, the impact shrinks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track it">
    ```
    Track this for me
    ```

    Tero monitors your progress and alerts you if you're falling behind. You'll hear from Tero when something changes, not when you remember to check.
