You've probably done renewal planning. A month before renewal, someone asks "what do we need next year?" You pull usage data from your vendor dashboard, extrapolate in a spreadsheet, add a buffer because you're not sure. You negotiate based on gut feel. Then you either overpay for capacity you don't use, or get hit with overages mid-year because you guessed wrong.

Or worse: you're three months into a contract and finance asks "are we on track?" You have no idea. You pull a report, do some math, shrug. "Probably?"

## What Tero tracks

Tero tracks spend on anything driven by data volume: logs, metrics, traces. Logs almost always are volume-based. Custom metrics often have separate overage charges. Traces and spans are typically volume-based too.

Some products like infrastructure monitoring are per-host. Tero doesn't optimize those. But volume-based components usually make up the majority of spend, and that's where waste lives.

## How pricing works

Every vendor prices differently.

Datadog, for example, uses a drawdown model. You commit to a dollar amount for the year at a negotiated discount, then draw down from that pool as you ingest data. Exhaust your commit early and you're on on-demand pricing, which is significantly more expensive. This is why early renewal is painful: you either pay overage rates or renew early with less leverage.

Other vendors use host-based pricing, usage-based tiers, or hybrid models. Tero understands these differences and maps your volume to actual dollars based on your specific contract terms.

## How projections work

Tero connects to your observability vendors and watches your actual data volume. Not estimates from a dashboard snapshot. Real ingestion, continuously.

A simple projection takes current usage and draws a line. That's usually wrong. Your usage has patterns: traffic spikes during holidays, quiet periods in summer, growth as you scale, drops when you optimize. Tero looks at historical trends, recent changes, and anomalies. If you've been reducing waste for three weeks, Tero factors that trajectory in. If you just deployed a service that's logging heavily, Tero notices.

Projections also have confidence ranges. Early in your contract, Tero has less data, so the range is wider. As the contract progresses, projections tighten. Tero shows you this: "Projected $420k, likely range $400-440k." You know what to trust.

## Projections you can change

Most projections are just forecasts. You watch the number and hope. Tero is different because it knows your [waste](/questions/waste). If 20% of your data is waste, Tero shows you exactly what eliminating it would do to your projection, and what it takes to get there.

You're not just watching a number. You're seeing the gap between where you're headed and where you could be.

And timing matters. If your renewal is in 12 months, eliminating waste today saves you 12 months of spend. Wait 6 months, you save 6 months. Wait until renewal, you save nothing on this contract. Tero quantifies this: "Eliminating 15% waste today saves $45k. In 3 months, that drops to $30k."

The projection isn't a forecast. It's a decision.
