Tero analyzes your data and surfaces rules. Each rule is a specific statement about what's wrong: this field duplicates that one, this log is a health check probe, this event fires a million times but represents one problem.

Rules are organized by [category](/data-quality/categories/overview). Each category is a type of mistake, something concrete that shouldn't be in your data.

## How Tero evaluates

Tero evaluates every log event, metric, and trace span against everything in your [context graph](/context/overview): query history, dashboards, alerts, service context, known failure scenarios. Not just one signal. All of them.

Some decisions come from evidence. You've never queried `k8s.pod.uid` in six months? That's a strong signal it's not useful. A metric tag appears in zero dashboards and zero alerts? Another signal.

Other decisions come from reasoning. Two fields have identical values, so one is redundant. A tag is an internal Kubernetes identifier and you have the human-readable name, so the UID serves no purpose. A log fires during health checks but never during real requests? Infrastructure noise.

Evidence and reasoning together. The same way you'd evaluate waste if you had time to look at every piece of telemetry. Tero does it continuously.

## The trust ladder

Once Tero finds issues, it organizes them by risk level so you can start with the obvious stuff and build confidence before tackling anything nuanced.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Zero risk" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981" horizontal>
    You'll agree immediately: [Redundant attributes](/data-quality/categories/logs/redundant-attributes), [Leftover debug logs](/data-quality/categories/logs/leftover-debug-logs), [Malformed data](/data-quality/categories/logs/malformed-data), and more
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low risk" icon="circle-half-stroke" color="#f59e0b" horizontal>
    Straightforward but worth a glance: [Health checks](/data-quality/categories/logs/health-checks), [Bot traffic](/data-quality/categories/logs/bot-traffic), [Unintended tool metadata](/data-quality/categories/logs/unintended-tool-metadata), and more
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium risk" icon="circle-exclamation" color="#ef4444" horizontal>
    Requires discussion with the team: [Excessive payloads](/data-quality/categories/logs/excessive-payloads), [PII leakage](/data-quality/categories/logs/pii-leakage), [Debug mode left on](/data-quality/categories/logs/debug-mode-left-on), and more

## Working through it

Start at the top of the ladder and work your way down. You don't review rules one by one. You review categories.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a category">
    Pick one. Start with something obvious like [redundant attributes](/data-quality/categories/logs/redundant-attributes) or [malformed data](/data-quality/categories/logs/malformed-data).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look at examples">
    Tero shows you real instances from your data. Understand why it's flagged. See the pattern.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve">
    If you agree, approve the whole category. Tero handles the rest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate or review">
    Some categories you'll automate forever. Others you'll want to review each time. Your call.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your ruleset grows over time. New rules surface as your systems evolve. You review incrementally. The work compounds.

## No regression

Once approved, rules are enforced. You [choose how](/data-quality/enforcement/overview): configure your provider, push to the edge, open PRs, create tickets.

If a problem resurfaces (an engineer re-enables debug logging, a new service emits the same waste pattern) Tero catches it. You see it in your next review.

Problems you fix stay fixed. That's the point.
