Tero analyzes your data and surfaces rules. Each rule is a specific statement about what's wrong: this field duplicates that one, this log is a health check probe, this event fires a million times but represents one problem.

Rules are organized by category. Each category is a type of problem: something concrete that shouldn't be in your data.

## The trust ladder

Tero organizes issues by risk level. Start at the top and work your way down.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Zero risk" icon="circle-check" color="#10b981" horizontal>
    You'll agree immediately: redundant attributes, leftover debug logs, malformed data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low risk" icon="circle-half-stroke" color="#f59e0b" horizontal>
    Straightforward but worth a glance: health checks, bot traffic, unintended tool metadata
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium risk" icon="circle-exclamation" color="#ef4444" horizontal>
    Requires discussion with the team: excessive payloads, debug mode left on, sampling decisions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Pick a category, look at examples from your data, approve if you agree. You review categories, not individual rules. Your ruleset grows over time.

## Categories

### Logs

Some categories affect attributes (fields within a log). Others affect entire events.

**Attribute-level** (the log stays, specific fields get removed):

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Redundant attributes" icon="copy" href="/data-quality/logs/redundant-attributes">
    Two fields with the same value
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unintended tool metadata" icon="wrench" href="/data-quality/logs/unintended-tool-metadata">
    Fields added by agents you never search
  </Card>
  <Card title="Excessive payloads" icon="weight-hanging" href="/data-quality/logs/excessive-payloads">
    Response bodies and large nested objects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Event-level** (the entire log gets dropped or sampled):

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Malformed data" icon="file-circle-xmark" href="/data-quality/logs/malformed-data">
    Binary blobs, corrupted output
  </Card>
  <Card title="Leftover debug logs" icon="bug" href="/data-quality/logs/leftover-debug-logs">
    Debug statements that shipped by accident
  </Card>
  <Card title="Debug mode left on" icon="toggle-on" href="/data-quality/logs/debug-mode-left-on">
    Verbose logging never disabled
  </Card>
  <Card title="Logs in hot path" icon="fire" href="/data-quality/logs/logs-in-hot-path">
    Log statements in middleware or tight loops
  </Card>
  <Card title="Health checks" icon="heart-pulse" href="/data-quality/logs/health-checks">
    Readiness probes, liveness checks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bot traffic" icon="robot" href="/data-quality/logs/bot-traffic">
    Crawlers, scrapers, automated scanners
  </Card>
  <Card title="Excessive repetition" icon="volume-high" href="/data-quality/logs/excessive-repetition">
    High volume where cost outweighs value
  </Card>
  <Card title="PII leakage" icon="shield-exclamation" href="/data-quality/logs/pii-leakage">
    Sensitive data that ended up in logs
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High cardinality tags" icon="chart-scatter" href="/data-quality/metrics/high-cardinality-tags">
    Tags with unbounded values that explode storage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Enforcement

Once you approve a rule, you choose how it gets enforced: configure your provider directly, push to the edge, open PRs, create tickets.

If a problem resurfaces, Tero catches it. Problems you fix stay fixed.
