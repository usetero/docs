Two fields with the same value. Literal duplicates. You're paying to store the same data twice.

## Why it happens

Different parts of your stack add the same information under different names:

- Your application logs `time`, your collector adds `@timestamp`
- Your SDK logs `level`, the OTel exporter adds `severity_text`
- Your service logs `host`, your agent adds `hostname`

Nobody planned this. It just accumulated.

## Example

The following log has three duplicate pairs: `time` and `@timestamp`, `level` and `severity_text`, `host` and `hostname`. Same values, different names. You're paying for each twice.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Before">
    ```json
    {
      "time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "level": "ERROR",
      "severity_text": "ERROR",
      "host": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "hostname": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "message": "Connection timeout"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After">
    ```json
    {
      "@timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "severity_text": "ERROR",
      "hostname": "checkout-api-7d8f9",
      "message": "Connection timeout"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Tero generates a scoped policy for each service where this pattern exists:

```yaml
id: remove-redundant-fields-checkout-api
name: Remove redundant fields from checkout-api
description: Drop duplicate timestamp, level, and host fields when they match their canonical equivalents.
log:
  match:
    - resource_attribute: service.name
      exact: checkout-api
    - or:
      - log_attribute: time
        equals_field: "@timestamp"
      - log_attribute: level
        equals_field: severity_text
      - log_attribute: host
        equals_field: hostname
  transform:
    remove:
      - log_attribute: time
      - log_attribute: level
      - log_attribute: host
```

<Tip>
  Want to apply this org-wide? You can expand the scope when you approve to enforce across all services, not just the ones where Tero detected the pattern.

## Recommended enforcement

<Card title="Enforce at edge" icon="server" href="/data-quality/enforcement/enforce-at-edge" horizontal>
  Drop the redundant field before data leaves your network. Immediate savings, no code changes.
</Card>

These fields are typically added by agents and collectors, not your application code. Fixing at the source would mean reconfiguring your entire observability stack. It's simpler to drop them at the edge.

## How it works

Tero analyzes every log event in your [context graph](/context/overview). When two fields contain identical values consistently (exact string matches, timestamps that differ only in format, numeric fields with the same value) they're flagged as redundant.

Fields that are *similar* but not identical aren't flagged. If `time` is UTC and `@timestamp` is local time, that's not redundant. Tero only flags true duplicates.
