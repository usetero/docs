Categories are types of mistakes. Each one is specific: a concrete problem Tero finds in your data.

Categories are organized by data type. Logs have their own set of mistakes. Metrics have theirs. As Tero expands to traces, those will get their own too.

## Logs

Mistakes that show up in your log data. Some affect attributes (fields within a log). Others affect entire events.

### Attribute-level

The log stays. Specific fields get removed.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Redundant attributes" icon="copy" href="/data-quality/categories/logs/redundant-attributes">
    Two fields with the same value
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unintended tool metadata" icon="wrench" href="/data-quality/categories/logs/unintended-tool-metadata">
    Fields added by agents you never search
  </Card>
  <Card title="Excessive payloads" icon="weight-hanging" href="/data-quality/categories/logs/excessive-payloads">
    Response bodies and large nested objects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Event-level

The entire log gets dropped or sampled.

    Binary blobs, corrupted output

## Metrics

Mistakes that show up in your metric data.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High cardinality tags" icon="chart-scatter" href="/data-quality/categories/metrics/high-cardinality-tags">
    Tags with unbounded values that explode storage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
