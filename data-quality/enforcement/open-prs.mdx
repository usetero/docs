Fix the problem at the source. Tero opens a pull request to remove or modify the instrumentation that's generating waste. Your team reviews and merges.

<Note>
Use this for code-level issues like leftover debug logs, excessive payloads, or logs in hot paths. The waste stops being generated instead of being filtered downstream.
</Note>

## How it works

Tero analyzes your codebase to find the instrumentation generating the waste. It creates a branch, makes the change, and opens a pull request. Your team reviews the PR like any other code change.

## Example

Tero identifies a debug log statement in `checkout-api` that shipped to production. The log says `"got here lol"` and fires 50,000 times per day.

You approve the rule and select "Open PRs." Tero locates the log statement in your codebase:

```python
# src/checkout/service.py, line 142
def process_order(order):
    logger.debug("got here lol")  # <-- Tero removes this line
    ...
```

Tero opens a pull request:

```
Title: Remove debug log from checkout-api

This debug statement shipped to production and generates 50,000 logs/day.
It doesn't appear in any dashboard or alert.

Identified by Tero: https://app.tero.dev/rules/abc123
```

Your team reviews the PR. Once merged and deployed, the logs stop being generated entirely. No filtering needed—the waste is gone at the source.

## When to use

Open PRs works best when:

- The waste is clearly a mistake (debug logs, forgotten print statements)
- The fix is straightforward (remove a line, change a log level)
- You want a permanent fix, not ongoing filtering

For configuration-based issues (debug mode left on), Tero can also open PRs to change config files if they're in version control.
