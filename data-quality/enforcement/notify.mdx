<Badge color="orange" icon="clock">Variable</Badge>

Send a notification to the right team. Lighter than a ticket—just awareness. The team decides whether to act.

<Note>
Use this for awareness without formal tracking. Good for low-priority issues or when you want human confirmation before taking action.
</Note>

## How it works

Tero sends a message to Slack or email with context about the issue. The notification includes what Tero found, the impact, and a link to take action in Tero.

## Setup

Connect your notification channel:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Slack" icon="slack" href="/integrations/slack">
    Send notifications to channels or DMs based on service ownership.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example

Tero identifies that `payment-service` is logging full request payloads including credit card data (masked, but still present).

You approve the rule and select "Notify." Tero sends a Slack message to #payments-team:

```
🔔 Tero identified an issue in payment-service

payment-service is logging full request payloads (~15KB per log).
This generates 2.1M logs/day at $3,200/day in costs.

The payloads contain masked credit card data. While masked,
this may still be a compliance concern.

```

The team sees the message, investigates, and decides how to respond. They might open a PR, create a ticket, or dismiss if it's intentional.

## When to use

Notify works best when:

- You want awareness without formal tracking
- The issue is low priority
- You want human confirmation before automated action
- Multiple people should see it but one person will own the response
