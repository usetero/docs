## Current Status

We're early stage and building compliance systematically. Here's where we are.

**SOC 2 Type 2** - Not certified yet. Targeting completion Q2 2025. Our infrastructure and practices are designed to meet SOC 2 requirements.

**ISO 27001** - Not certified yet. Planned for 2025 following SOC 2 completion.

**Penetration Testing** - First third-party pen test planned Q1 2025. Results available to enterprise customers on request.

**Bug Bounty Program** - Not launched yet. Planned for Q2 2025 following pen test.

## Supported Frameworks

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** - We provide data access, portability, deletion, and Standard Contractual Clauses for EU customers.

**CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)** - We provide data access, deletion, and opt-out capabilities for California residents.

**HIPAA** - Not certified. If you need HIPAA compliance, use the self-hosted control plane option with your own BAA.

**PCI DSS** - Not applicable. We don't process, store, or transmit credit card data. Payments handled by Stripe (PCI DSS Level 1 certified).

## Audit Reports

**SOC 2 Report** - Not available yet. Targeting Q2 2025.

**Penetration Test Report** - Not available yet. First test planned Q1 2025. Results available to enterprise customers under NDA.

**Security Questionnaires** - We respond to standard questionnaires (SIG, CAIQ, VSA). Email [{securityEmail}](mailto:{securityEmail}) with your questionnaire.

## Data Processing Agreement

**DPA availability** - Standard DPA available on request for customers processing EU personal data.

**Standard Contractual Clauses** - We provide SCCs for international data transfers under GDPR.

**Business Associate Agreement** - Not available. For HIPAA requirements, use self-hosted option.

Email [{securityEmail}](mailto:{securityEmail}) to request our DPA.

## Compliance Controls

Even without formal certifications, we implement security controls aligned with SOC 2 and ISO 27001:

**Access management** - Role-based access, MFA required, least privilege principles.

**Data protection** - Encryption in transit and at rest, secure key management, regular backups.

**Change management** - Code review required, staging environment, rollback procedures.

**Incident response** - Documented procedures, 24-hour notification for data incidents.

**Vendor management** - Third-party risk assessment for all sub-processors (see Sub-Processors page).

**Security monitoring** - Automated threat detection, audit logging, vulnerability scanning.

**Employee security** - Background checks, security training, device management, offboarding procedures.

## Self-Hosted Compliance

For strict compliance requirements, the self-hosted control plane gives you complete control:

**Your compliance boundary** - All data stays in your infrastructure. Tero never processes customer data.

**Your certifications** - Inherit your existing SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or other certifications.

**Your BAA** - Use your own Business Associate Agreement for HIPAA compliance.

**Your region** - Deploy in your required geographic region for data residency.

**Your audit** - Include Tero in your existing compliance audits as internal software.

## Compliance Roadmap

**Q1 2025** - Third-party penetration test, vulnerability disclosure program.

**Q2 2025** - SOC 2 Type 2 audit completion, bug bounty program launch.

**H2 2025** - ISO 27001 certification (based on customer demand).

**2026** - Additional certifications based on enterprise customer requirements.

This timeline assumes current customer demand and company growth. Email [{securityEmail}](mailto:{securityEmail}) if you need specific certifications for procurement—it helps us prioritize.
