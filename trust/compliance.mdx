Compliance status depends on your deployment option. Self-hosted gives you complete control.

## Self-Hosted Compliance

When you self-host the control plane, compliance becomes simpler:

**Your compliance boundary** - All data stays in your infrastructure. Tero never processes customer data.

**Your certifications** - Inherit your existing SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or other certifications. Tero runs as internal software.

**Your audit scope** - Include Tero in your existing compliance audits. No separate vendor audit required.

**Your data residency** - Deploy in any region. Meet your geographic data requirements.

**Your BAA** - Use your own Business Associate Agreement for HIPAA compliance.

This is the path for organizations with strict compliance requirements that can't wait for vendor certifications.

## Compliance Controls

Even without formal certifications, we implement controls aligned with SOC 2 and ISO 27001:

**Access management** - Role-based access, MFA required, least privilege, temporary production access.

**Data protection** - Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256), secure key management, daily backups.

**Change management** - Code review required, staging environment, automated testing, rollback procedures.

**Incident response** - Documented plan, 24-hour notification for data incidents, post-incident reviews.

**Vendor management** - Third-party risk assessment for all sub-processors. See Sub-Processors page.

**Security monitoring** - Automated threat detection, audit logging, vulnerability scanning, GCP Security Command Center.

**Employee security** - Background checks, security training, device management, access revocation on offboarding.
