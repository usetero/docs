## What each integration accesses

Each integration documents exactly what permissions it requires and why.

| Integration | What Tero accesses |
|-------------|-------------------|
| [Datadog](/integrations/datadog#permissions) | Logs, metrics, traces, service catalog. Optional write access for exclusion filters. |
| [Splunk](/integrations/splunk#permissions) | Logs, index metadata. Optional write access for ingest actions. |
| [GitHub](/integrations/github#permissions) | Repository contents, PRs, issues. For code fixes and policy sync. |
| [Anthropic](/integrations/anthropic) | Telemetry samples for AI classification. Zero retention. |

## Sub-processors

| Service | Purpose | Data | Location |
|---------|---------|------|----------|
| Google Cloud Platform | Infrastructure | Control plane, backups | US |
| Anthropic | AI classification (default) | Samples, not persisted | US |
| WorkOS | Authentication | Email, SSO tokens | US |
| Stripe | Payments (self-service only) | Billing info | US |

<Tip>
**Self-hosted**: No sub-processors. Everything runs in your infrastructure.

We notify customers 30 days before adding sub-processors that handle data.
