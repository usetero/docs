## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to operate Tero:

| Service | Purpose | Data Processed | Location | Trust Center |
|---------|---------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) | Infrastructure hosting | Control plane data, backups | United States | [GCP Trust Center](https://cloud.google.com/trust-center) |
| [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com) | AI classification (default) | Telemetry samples (not persisted) | United States | [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com/) |
| [OpenAI](https://openai.com) | AI classification (configurable) | Telemetry samples (not persisted) | United States | [OpenAI Trust Portal](https://trust.openai.com/) |
| [WorkOS](https://workos.com) | Authentication (SSO) | User email, authentication tokens | United States | [WorkOS Security](https://workos.com/security) |
| [Stripe](https://stripe.com) | Payment processing | Billing information, payment methods | United States | [Stripe Security](https://docs.stripe.com/security) |

## Self-Hosted Option

When you self-host the control plane, you control which third-party services are used:

**Required** - None. Self-hosted control plane runs entirely in your infrastructure.

**Optional** - You can configure Tero to use your own AI provider (AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, etc.) with your API keys and data residency requirements.

**Not applicable** - GCP, WorkOS, and Stripe are only used for Tero-hosted control plane.

## Data Flow

**Tero-hosted control plane:**
1. Your observability platform API (read-only) → Tero control plane (GCP)
2. Telemetry samples → AI provider (Anthropic or OpenAI) → Classification results → Tero
3. User authentication → WorkOS → Tero
4. Billing events → Stripe → Tero

**Self-hosted control plane:**
1. Your observability platform API (read-only) → Your infrastructure
2. Telemetry samples → Your AI provider (or none) → Your infrastructure
3. No external services required
