Tero analyzes your observability telemetry to identify waste and suggest optimizations. This requires access to some of your data. This section explains what we see, what we store, how we protect it, and how you stay in control.

## Progressive Trust

You don't have to trust us on day one. Start with read-only access and add capabilities as you gain confidence. Every step is optional.

<ProgressiveTrustSteps />

## Security

We protect the data we handle with industry-standard practices and infrastructure. Everything is encrypted, access is controlled and logged, and our edge proxies are designed to fail safely.

**Key points:**
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)
- Role-based access control with MFA required
- Infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform with multi-zone deployment
- Edge proxies fail open and never block your observability data
- Self-hosted option for complete infrastructure control

## Privacy

You control what data you send to Tero. We build a semantic catalog from telemetry metadata (schemas, volumes, and patterns) but we don't store your log content, metric values, or trace data.

**Key points:**
- Telemetry metadata only, not the content itself
- No customer data from your logs
- Data subject rights supported (access, correction, deletion, portability)
- Clear retention policies for all data types
- Self-hosted option keeps everything in your infrastructure

## Compliance

We're building toward SOC 2 Type 2, penetration testing, and ISO 27001 certification. In the meantime, we implement controls aligned with these frameworks. Self-hosting changes the equation. When the control plane runs in your infrastructure, you inherit your existing certifications.

**Key points:**
- SOC 2 Type 2 planned Q2 2025
- Penetration testing planned Q1 2025
- GDPR and CCPA compliant (DPA and SCCs available)
- Controls implemented now, formal audits in progress
- Self-hosted deployment inherits your certifications

## Resilience

Our architecture minimizes risk to your production systems. The control plane runs separately from your critical path. Edge proxies fail open and cache rules locally. If Tero is unavailable, your observability continues unaffected.

**Key points:**
- Control plane not in your critical path
- 99.9% uptime target for control plane
- Edge fails open and never blocks telemetry flow
- Local rule caching means edge works without control plane
- Daily backups with multi-zone replication
