Tero analyzes your observability telemetry to identify waste and suggest optimizations. We need access to some of your data to do this. This section explains what we see, what we store, and how we protect it.

## How It Works

**Start with read-only access.** Connect Tero to your observability platform (Datadog, etc.) with read-only API permissions. We analyze your telemetry, build a semantic catalog of what you're sending, and show you where the waste is. No infrastructure changes required.

**Grant write access if you want us to optimize for you.** If you want Tero to configure exclusion rules or adjust sampling—instead of doing it yourself—grant write permissions to your observability platform. This is optional. Scope permissions however you need. Revoke them anytime.

**Deploy edge when you're ready.** The edge proxy runs in your infrastructure and blocks waste before it leaves your network. This delivers the biggest savings but requires deploying software in your environment. Many customers start API-only and add edge later.

**Self-host for complete control.** The control plane can run entirely in your infrastructure. Your data, your network, your compliance boundary. We provide the software, you run it.

Progressive trust. You control every step.
