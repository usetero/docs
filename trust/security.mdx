## What Data We Handle

**We build a semantic catalog of your telemetry, not a data warehouse.**

When you connect Tero to your observability platform, we read log samples to understand patterns and structure. We use this to build metadata about what you're sending—schemas, volumes, quality patterns.

### What We Store

- Event schemas (field names, types, patterns)
- Volume metrics (events per hour, per service)
- Quality classifications (valuable, waste, mixed)
- Rules and configurations you create
- Account and workspace settings

### What We Don't Store

- Raw log content
- Metric values
- Trace data
- Customer data from your logs

**Example:** We store "payment_failed has fields: user_id (string), error_code (string), amount (number)" but NOT "user_id=12345, error_code=CARD_DECLINED, amount=99.99".

### AI Analysis

We use AI to classify telemetry and identify patterns. By default, we use Anthropic Claude. Sample data is sent to the AI, processed in memory, then discarded—never persisted in our database.

You can configure Tero to use your approved AI provider instead (AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, etc.). Or self-host the control plane entirely—data never leaves your network.

## Infrastructure

**Platform** - Google Cloud Platform.

**Encryption** - Everything encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).

**Isolation** - Production, staging, and development run in separate GCP projects.

**Network security** - Private networks, VPC isolation, minimal public exposure.

**Monitoring** - GCP Security Command Center monitors for threats. All infrastructure access logged.

**Database** - PostgreSQL managed by GCP. Encrypted, backed up daily, replicated across zones.

## Access Controls

**Authentication** - SSO with multi-factor authentication required. No shared accounts.

**Role-based access** - Least privilege. Engineers access development environments. Limited production access for operations only.

**Temporary access** - Production access is time-limited and requires justification.

**Audit logs** - Every production access logged with who, what, when, and why.

## Application Security

**Code review** - Every change reviewed before merging. No solo production deploys.

**Dependencies** - Automated scanning for vulnerabilities. Regular security updates.

**Secrets** - Stored in Doppler and GCP Secret Manager. Never in code or config files.

**APIs** - Rate limiting, authentication, input validation on all endpoints.

## Edge Security

The edge proxy runs in your infrastructure.

**Local processing** - Edge applies quality rules at line rate in your network. Only rule execution results leave your infrastructure—no log content, no metric values, no trace data.

**Flexible deployment** - Deploy as sidecar, in your pipeline, or standalone. You control the architecture.

**Rule sync** - Edge pulls quality rules from the control plane over encrypted connection. You can review rules before deployment.

## Self-Hosted Option

The entire control plane can run in your infrastructure.

**What runs in your network** - Control plane service, PostgreSQL database, semantic catalog—everything.

**Your data stays yours** - Nothing leaves your infrastructure. We provide the software, you control the deployment.

**Your AI** - Use your AI infrastructure with your keys.

**Support** - We provide updates, documentation, and support. You manage the infrastructure.

## Incident Response

**Detection** - Automated monitoring, application alerts, anomaly detection.

**Response** - Documented incident response plan. Security team notified immediately.

**Communication** - If an incident affects customer data, we notify affected customers within 24 hours.

**Post-incident** - Root cause analysis and improvements after every incident.
