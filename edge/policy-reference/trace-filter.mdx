  policies. Trace support is in development.
</Note>

## Planned Capabilities

Trace filtering will support:

- **Span matching** by name, kind, status, and attributes
- **Resource matching** by service name, version, and other attributes
- **Drop** decisions at the span or trace level
- **Sampling** by percentage or rate limit

## Current Options

While trace filtering is in development, you can:

1. **Sample at the source** using OpenTelemetry SDK head sampling
2. **Use Tail Sampling Processor** in OpenTelemetry Collector
3. **Filter downstream** in your observability platform
