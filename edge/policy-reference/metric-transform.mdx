<Note>
  Metric transform policies are coming soon. Currently, Edge supports filtering
  metrics but not transforming them.
</Note>

## Planned Capabilities

Metric transform will support:

- **Remove** - Delete datapoint attributes to reduce cardinality
- **Rename** - Normalize metric names and attribute keys
- **Add** - Insert metadata attributes

## Current Options

While metric transforms are in development, you can:

1. **Filter aggressively** using
   [metric filter policies](/edge/policies/metric-filter)
2. **Transform at the source** in your application or OpenTelemetry Collector
3. **Use log transforms** for any data that can be sent as structured logs
