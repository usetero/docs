  "A lightweight telemetry proxy for policy-based filtering and transformation"
---

Edge is a high-performance telemetry proxy that applies policies to your
observability data before it reaches your backends. It sits between your
applications and observability platforms, filtering noise, redacting sensitive
data, and transforming telemetry in real-time.

## Why Edge?

Observability platforms charge by volume. As your infrastructure grows, so does
the noise—debug logs, health checks, internal metrics. You're paying to store
data you'll never query.

Edge solves this by processing telemetry in your environment:

- **Filter noise** before it leaves your infrastructure
- **Redact sensitive data** to meet compliance requirements
- **Transform fields** to normalize across services
- **Sample high-volume events** to control costs

All without changing application code.

## How It Works

Edge operates as a proxy between your telemetry sources and destinations:

```
Applications → Edge → Observability Platform
                  ↓
              Policies
```

1. **Receive** telemetry via standard protocols (OTLP, Datadog API)
2. **Evaluate** policies against each log, metric, or trace
3. **Apply** actions: drop, sample, transform, or pass through
4. **Forward** surviving telemetry to your backend

Policies are evaluated in parallel for each piece of telemetry. There's no
sequential pipeline—matching policies contribute their actions, and the most
restrictive action wins.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Policy-Based Processing" icon="filter">
    Define rules that match specific telemetry and apply actions. Policies are
    atomic and independent—no dependencies between them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hot Reload" icon="rotate">
    Update policies without restarting. Edge watches for changes and applies
    them instantly with zero downtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fail-Open" icon="shield-check">
    If a policy fails to evaluate, telemetry passes through unchanged. Edge
    prioritizes availability over strict filtering.

  <Card title="High Performance" icon="bolt">
    Built in Zig with lock-free reads and Vectorscan regex matching. Handles
    thousands of policies with sub-millisecond overhead.

## Distributions

Edge ships as focused distributions, each optimized for specific protocols:

| Distribution                                | Protocols                     | Use Case                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [Edge](/edge/distributions/all)             | All protocols                 | Multi-vendor environments         |
| [Edge Datadog](/edge/distributions/datadog) | Datadog Logs API, Metrics API | Datadog-native environments       |
| [Edge OTLP](/edge/distributions/otlp)       | OpenTelemetry Protocol        | OpenTelemetry-native environments |

Choose the distribution that matches your telemetry stack.

## Comparisons to Other Solutions

The Edge proxy is not designed to replace other telemetry pipelines like the
OpenTelemetry Collector, Datadog Agent, or Vector. Instead, it complements these
solutions by providing an incredibly performant, policy-driven approach to
processing telemetry in your environment.

### Reach for the Edge if:

- You need to filter noise before it leaves your infrastructure.
- You need to redact sensitive data to meet compliance requirements.
- You need to process telemetry in your environment.
- You struggle with latency or throughput issues.
- You want zero-downtime, sub-millisecond remote configuration.

### Rely on telemetry pipelines for:

- Routing telemetry data to external systems.
- Translating telemetry data formats.
