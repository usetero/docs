Connect GitHub to let Tero open pull requests, create issues, and sync policies to your repositories.

## Connect

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Run tero">
        Open your terminal and run:

        ```bash
        tero
        ```

        This opens the Tero TUI, which guides you through setup.

        <Note>
        Don't have the CLI installed? See the [quickstart](/quickstart).
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Log in to Tero">
        The TUI opens your browser to create an account or log in. Complete the flow in your browser, then confirm the code shown in your terminal. The TUI logs you in automatically.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Select GitHub">
        The TUI asks which integration you want to connect. Select GitHub.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
        The TUI opens your browser to [install the Tero GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/tero). Select which repositories Tero can access. You can grant access to all repositories or select specific ones.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Authorize">
        GitHub asks you to authorize the app. Review the permissions and approve. You're redirected back to Tero.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Done">
        Tero confirms the connection. You can now open PRs, create issues, and sync policies to your repositories.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
