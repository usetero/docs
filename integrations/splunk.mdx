Connect Splunk to give Tero context and enable actions directly in your instance.

## Connect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run tero">
    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    tero
    ```

    This opens the Tero TUI, which guides you through setup.

    <Note>
    Don't have the CLI installed? See the [quickstart](/quickstart).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in to Tero">
    The TUI opens your browser to create an account or log in. Complete the flow in your browser, then confirm the code shown in your terminal. The TUI logs you in automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Splunk">
    The TUI asks which integration you want to connect. Select Splunk.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your Splunk URL">
    Enter your Splunk instance URL. For Splunk Cloud, this is `your-instance.splunkcloud.com`. For Splunk Enterprise, it's your self-hosted URL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an authentication token">
    The TUI asks for an authentication token. Splunk uses this to authenticate API requests.

    In Splunk, go to **Settings → Tokens**. Click **New Token**, select a user with the appropriate role (see [Permissions](#permissions)), and set an expiration. Copy the token and paste it into the TUI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done">
    Tero validates your credentials and starts analyzing your environment. You'll see a progress bar — analysis usually takes a couple of minutes, even with billions of logs.

    Once it's done, you're ready to ask your first question.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Context

When you connect Splunk, Tero adds to your [context graph](/context/overview). Your logs and services become connected and understood.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Services" icon="circle-nodes" iconType="duotone" href="/context/services" horizontal>
    Your services and their relationships.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Log Events" icon="file-lines" iconType="duotone" href="/context/log-events" horizontal>
    Your logs compressed into semantic events Tero can reason about.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Actions

With write access, Tero can take action directly in Splunk:

</Frame>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Ingest Actions" icon="filter" iconType="duotone" href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Data/DataIngest" horizontal>
    Tero configures rulesets to filter waste logs before indexing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These are Splunk-specific. You can always take action other ways — deploy policies to your infrastructure with [Edge](/edge/overview), adjust instrumentation in your code, or configure Splunk manually. See [Taking action](/questions/waste/taking-action) for all options.

## Permissions

Splunk uses [capabilities](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/latest/Security/Rolesandcapabilities) to control access. Create a role with the capabilities Tero needs, or use an existing role.

| Role | What it gives Tero |
|------|-------------------|
| **admin** | Full context and actions |
| **power** | Context only — you take action elsewhere |
| **Custom** | You decide — see below |

### Custom role capabilities

Create a custom role if you need fine-grained control.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Context (read)">
    | Capability | What Tero can do |
    |------------|------------------|
    | `search` | Search your logs |
    | `list_inputs` | List data inputs |
    | `get_metadata` | Read index metadata |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Actions (write)">
    | Capability | What Tero can do |
    |------------|------------------|
    | `list_ingest_rulesets` | View ingest action rulesets |
    | `edit_ingest_rulesets` | Create and modify rulesets |
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Start minimal and add capabilities later. Update the token's role in Splunk and Tero picks up the changes automatically.
