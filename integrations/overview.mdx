Integrations connect Tero to your observability tools. Each integration brings [context](/context/overview) and unlocks [questions](/questions/waste/getting-started) you can ask.

## What integrations bring

When you connect an integration, Tero:

- **Discovers your services** from service catalogs, APM, and infrastructure
- **Maps your telemetry** to semantic log events, metrics, and traces
- **Pulls usage data** for renewal projections and contract tracking
- **Enables actions** like configuring exclusion filters directly in your provider

The more you connect, the richer Tero's understanding. Each integration adds nodes and edges to your [context graph](/context/overview).
