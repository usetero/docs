Tero integrates with the agents and collectors in your infrastructure to apply policies before telemetry reaches your observability platform.

## How it works

Tero Edge runs alongside your existing agents. You configure your agent to send telemetry through Edge. Edge applies policies (drop, sample, transform) and forwards to your backend.

Policies sync automatically from Tero. No restarts, no redeploys. Update a policy in Tero, it applies within seconds.

## Integrations

## Why filter in your infrastructure?

  <Card title="No limits" icon="infinity">
    Observability platforms cap how many filters or rules you can create. Tero policies have no limits.

  <Card title="No ingestion fees" icon="dollar-sign">
    Platform-side filters prevent indexing but not ingestion. Infrastructure filtering drops data before it's sent.

## Tero Edge

Edge is the policy engine that runs in your infrastructure. It's a lightweight proxy built for high-throughput telemetry.

See [Edge documentation](/edge/overview) for architecture, configuration, and policy reference.
