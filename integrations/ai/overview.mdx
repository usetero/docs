<Note>
Most customers don't need to configure this. Tero works out of the box using our AI accounts with zero-retention agreements. Only set up your own provider if your security team requires it, you want AI costs on your bill, or you have existing provider agreements.
</Note>

Tero uses AI to classify your telemetry and identify waste. If you need to use your own AI provider, you can configure Tero to use your API keys instead.

## Providers

| Provider | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| [Anthropic](/integrations/ai/anthropic) | Recommended. Most accurate for telemetry classification. |
| [OpenAI](/integrations/ai/openai) | Works well. Good choice if you have existing agreements. |
| [AWS Bedrock](/integrations/ai/aws-bedrock) | Self-hosted only. Data stays in your AWS environment. |

## Why bring your own?

- **Compliance**: Your security team requires AI requests go through your accounts
- **Cost tracking**: You want AI costs on your bill, not bundled with Tero
- **Existing agreements**: You have negotiated rates or specific terms with a provider
- **Preference**: You prefer one provider over another

If none of these apply, you don't need to configure anything.

## Primary and fallback

You can configure a primary provider and an optional fallback. If your primary is unavailable (API errors, authentication failures), Tero switches to the fallback automatically.

Rate limits do not trigger fallback.

## Self-hosted

When you self-host Tero, you must configure your own AI provider. Tero's accounts are only available on Tero Cloud.
