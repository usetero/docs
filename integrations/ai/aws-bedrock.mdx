Use AWS Bedrock for Tero's AI classification. Your data stays in your AWS environment.

<Note>
Bedrock is only available for self-hosted Tero deployments.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with Bedrock enabled
- Access to Claude models in Bedrock
- AWS credentials (access key/secret or IAM role)

Configuring AWS IAM and Bedrock access is outside the scope of this document. See [AWS Bedrock documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/).

## Data handling

With Bedrock, your telemetry samples never leave your AWS environment. Data is processed by Bedrock in your account, subject to your AWS agreements and compliance controls.

## Fallback

You can configure another provider as a fallback in case Bedrock is unavailable. Fallback triggers on unrecoverable errors (API unavailable, authentication failures). Rate limits do not trigger fallback.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet (via Bedrock) |
| **Credentials** | AWS access key/secret or IAM role |
| **Region** | Any region with Bedrock and Claude access |
