## Data handling

Anthropic's API has a [zero-retention policy](https://www.anthropic.com/policies/privacy) for API requests. Samples sent for classification are:

- Processed in memory
- Not stored by Anthropic
- Not used to train models

## Fallback

You can configure OpenAI as a fallback in case Anthropic is unavailable. Fallback triggers on unrecoverable errors (API unavailable, authentication failures). Rate limits do not trigger fallback.

## API key

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
